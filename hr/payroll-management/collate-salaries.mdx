<Card title="Prerequisites" icon="sparkles" iconType="duotone">
  - The desired **Payroll Period** (e.g., “June 2025”) exists and is in **Open** status under `HR > Payroll Entry > Payroll Period List.`
  - All changes (attendance, overtime, leave adjustments, deductions) for that period have been recorded.
  - Each employee intended for inclusion has an active **Salary Structure** assigned under `HR > Salary Structure.`
  - Any one‐time or recurring deductions, allowances, or bonuses for this period are set up in **Deduction Entry** or **Allowance Entry**.
  - Under `Setup > Payroll Settings`, the default **Bank Account** for salary disbursement is configured.
</Card>

### Step 1: Verify Payroll Configuration

1. **Confirm Payroll Settings**
   - Navigate to `Setup > Payroll Settings.`
   - Ensure that:
     - **Default Currency** is correct (e.g., NGN).
     - **Salary Components Defaults** (Basic, HRA, etc.) are up to date.
     - **Statutory Rates** (tax, pension) reflect the current period.
2. **Check Bank Account**
   - Under **Payroll Settings**, verify the **Bank Account** configured for salary disbursements.
   - This account will be used to generate the consolidated payment file (if integrated with banking).
3. **Review Approval Workflow**
   - If your process requires sign‐off (e.g., Finance Controller approval), ensure that the **Payroll Entry** for the period is in **Pending Approval** status and the approver is notified.

### Step 2: Generate the Payroll for the Period

1. **Initiate Payroll Run**
   - Go to `HR > Payroll Entry > New.`
   - In the form, select:
     - **Company** (e.g., “CGIC Nigeria Ltd”).
     - **Payroll Period** (e.g., “June 2025”).
     - **Payroll Type**: “Full and Final,” “Monthly Salary,” or “Wage.” Choose “Monthly Salary” unless wages are paid separately.
   - Click **Save**.
2. **Verify Earnings and Deductions**
   - In the **Earnings** section, confirm that for each employee:
     - **Basic Pay**, **Allowances**, **Overtime** (if any) are listed.
     - Any **Bonus** entries appear correctly.
   - In the **Deductions** section, ensure all items—**Tax**, **Pension**, **Health Insurance**, **Loan Repayment**—are reflected.
3. **Calculate Net Pay**
   - Once earnings and deductions are correct, click **Calculate Net Pay**. The CGIC App computes:
     - **Total Earnings** = Sum of all pay components.
     - **Total Deductions** = Sum of all statutory and non‐statutory deductions.
     - **Net Pay** = Total Earnings − Total Deductions.
4. **Review Individual Payslips**
   - Scroll through the generated payslip grid. Look for any discrepancies (e.g., unexpected zero amounts where values should exist).
   - If corrections are needed, either:
     - Update the underlying **Salary Structure**, **Deduction Entry**, or **Allowance Entry**.
     - Then click **Recalculate** to refresh net pay.
5. **Submit Payroll Entry**
   - After validation, click **Submit** on the Payroll Entry. This moves the payroll into **Submitted** status, ready for collation.

### Step 3: Collate Salary Totals

1. **Access Salary Summary Report**
   - Navigate to `HR > Reports > Payroll Summary Report.`
   - Set filters:
     - **Payroll Period** = “June 2025.”
     - **Department** (optional) to view department‐wise totals.
     - **Cost Center** (optional) if you track by project or location.
   - Click **Refresh**.
2. **Review Key Columns**
   - **Employee Count**: Number of employees included.
   - **Gross Salary Total**: Sum of all employees’ total earnings.
   - **Total Deductions**: Sum of all employees’ deductions.
   - **Net Salary Total**: Gross Salary − Total Deductions.
   - **Employer Contributions** (if captured separately).
3. **Drill Down as Needed**
   - Click on any department or cost center row to view individual employee details for that segment.
   - Verify unusual figures (e.g., very high overtime) before proceeding.
4. **Export Collated Data**
   - Click `Menu > Export > CSV` to download a spreadsheet containing:
     - Each employee’s **Employee Code**, **Name**, **Gross**, **Deductions**, **Net Pay**, **Bank Account Number**, and **Department/Cost Center**.
   - Alternatively, choose `Export > PDF` for a formatted report summary.

### Step 4: Prepare Disbursement File (If Integrated)

1. **Generate Bank File Format**
   - If your CGIC App is integrated with banking:
     - In **Payroll Entry**, after submission, click **Generate Bank File**.
     - Choose the **Bank Format** (e.g., “GTBank NIBSS,” “Standard Chartered CSV”).
   - The system produces a file ready for upload to your bank’s payroll portal.
2. **Verify Bank File Contents**
   - Before uploading, download the file and open it in a text editor or spreadsheet to confirm:
     - **Beneficiary Name**, **Bank Account Number**, **Net Amount** for each employee.
     - No blank or incorrect account numbers.
   - Correct any discrepancies by amending the employee’s **Bank Account** field in their profile and regenerating the file.
3. **Upload to Bank Portal**
   - Log in to your bank’s corporate payroll site.
   - Upload the generated file.
   - Complete any additional validations (e.g., OTP confirmations).
   - Upon successful upload, retrieve the bank’s confirmation receipt and save a copy in a secure location.

### Step 5: Consolidate and Archive Salary Data

1. **Generate Final Payroll Register**
   - In `HR > Reports > Payroll Register Report`, set:
     - **Payroll Period** = “June 2025.”
   - Click **Refresh** to produce a detailed listing of all salary components and deductions per employee.
   - Export to PDF for official payroll records.
2. **Archive Payroll Entry**
   - Once payroll is disbursed and bank confirmation is received, change the **Payroll Entry** status to **Closed** or **Paid** (depending on your workflow).
   - This prevents further edits and signals completion.
3. **Notify Stakeholders**
   - Use **Email Alert** or **Mass Email** from the Payroll Entry:
     - To send payslips to employees (if enabled).
     - To send summary confirmation to Finance and Management (e.g., total payroll cost, department breakdowns).
4. **Store Documentation**
   - Save exported summaries, bank acknowledgments, and any approval screenshots in a shared, secure folder (e.g., “Payroll Records FY2025”).
   - Tag them with the payroll period and date for easy retrieval during audits.
