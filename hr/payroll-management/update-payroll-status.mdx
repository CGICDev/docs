<Info>
  **Prerequisites**

  - One or more payroll runs (Pay Period entries) already exist under **HR \> Payroll \> Payroll Entry List.**


  - Each payroll entry has valid salary slips generated and, if already submitted, journal entries posted. 


  - Bank accounts for salary disbursement are configured under `Accounts > Bank Account List.`  


  - Payroll expense, liability, and bank accounts are mapped correctly in `Accounts > Chart of Accounts.`
</Info>

### Step 1: Locate the Payroll Entry

1. Navigate to `HR > Payroll > Payroll Entry > Payroll Entry List.`  

2. Use the **Search Bar** or `Filter > Add Filter` to find the specific payroll run by:  

   - **Pay Period** (e.g., “June 2025”)  

   - **Status** (Draft, Submitted, Paid, or Cancelled)  

   - **Company** (if you have multiple entities)  

3. Click the **Payroll Entry No.** to open its detail view.

### Step 2: Change Status from Draft to Submitted

1. Open a payroll entry in **Draft** status.  

2. Review each salary slip in the **Salary Slips** table to ensure components, attendance, and deductions are correct.  

3. Click **Submit** at the top-right.  

   - The system validates that all required fields (Pay Period, Company, Salary Slips) are completed.  

   - Upon successful validation:  

     - All salary slips become “Submitted.”  

     - Payroll journal entries post to the general ledger, debiting payroll expense accounts and crediting payroll liability accounts.  

     - The payroll entry’s status updates to **Submitted**.  

4. If a validation error occurs (e.g., missing salary slip for an employee), correct the issue and click **Submit** again.

### Step 3: Mark a Submitted Payroll Entry as Paid

1. Open a payroll entry with `Status = Submitted.`  

2. Confirm that bank funding is available and salary disbursement is scheduled.  

3. Click `Actions > Mark as Paid` (or **Create Bank Entry**, depending on your setup):  

   - If using **Mark as Paid**, CGIC:  

     - Prompts for **Payment Date** (e.g., today’s date).  

     - Requires selecting the **Bank Account** used to disburse net pay.  

     - Calculates the total net pay amount from salary slips.  

     - Creates a **Bank Voucher** journal entry that debits payroll liability accounts and credits the chosen bank account.  

     - Updates each salary slip’s status to **Paid**.  

     - Updates the payroll entry’s status to **Paid**.  

   - If using **Create Bank Entry**, CGIC opens a draft Bank Voucher with all net pay lines pre-filled—review and **Submit** to record payment.  

4. Click **Submit** (or **Save & Submit**) to finalize payment. The payroll run’s status becomes **Paid**.

### Step 4: Cancel a Payroll Entry

**4.1 Cancel a Draft Payroll Entry  **

1. Open a payroll entry in **Draft** status.  

2. Click `Actions > Cancel.`  

   - The status immediately changes to **Cancelled**.  

   - You may later create a new payroll entry for the same period if required.

**4.2 Cancel a Submitted Payroll Entry  **

<Warning>
  Cancelling after submission will reverse all related journal entries and reset salary slip statuses. Do this only if the run contained errors (e.g., incorrect salary structure, missing employees).
</Warning>

1. Open the payroll entry in **Submitted** status.  

2. Ensure no salary slips have already been paid. If any are marked Paid, reverse the “Paid” status first (see Step 5 below).  

3. Click `Actions > Cancel.`  

   - CGIC reverses all journal entries created during submission (reversing payroll expense and liability entries).  

   - All salary slips revert to **Draft** status (allowing corrections).  

   - The payroll entry’s status updates to **Cancelled**.  

4. Correct underlying issues (e.g., adjust leave days or component values) and re-run payroll for that period if needed.

**4.3 Cancel a Paid Payroll Entry  **

<Warning>
  Cancelling a Paid payroll run is a sensitive operation that impacts bank reconciliation and employee payments.
</Warning>

1. Open the payroll entry in **Paid** status.  

2. Click `Actions > Reverse Payment` (or **Cancel** if no “Reverse Payment” button exists).  

   - CGIC:  

     - Reverses the bank voucher by creating a mirror entry (debiting bank, crediting payroll liability)\
     - Resets each salary slip to **Submitted** status.  \
     - Updates the payroll entry status to **Submitted**.  

3. Now, follow Step 3 steps to mark as Paid again using corrected data, or follow Step 4.2 to cancel entirely.

### **Step 5: Verify Status Changes and Audit**

1. Open the payroll entry after a status change.  

2. In the **Status** field, confirm it reflects the latest state (Draft, Submitted, Paid, or Cancelled).  

3. Click `Menu > View History` to see a detailed log of all actions taken:  

   - Who changed the status (user name)  

   - When the change occurred (timestamp)  

   - What journal entries were posted or reversed  

   - Any notes entered during cancellation or reversal
