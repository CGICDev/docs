  **Prerequisites**

  - Payroll entries and payslips have been generated and submitted for each period.
  - Deduction and allowance details for each period are finalized before archiving.
</Info>

### Step 1: Verify and Finalize Payroll Entries

1. **Confirm All Payroll Entries Are Submitted**
   - Go to `HR > Payroll Entry > Payroll Entry List` and ensure each payroll period has status **Submitted** or **Closed/Paid**.
   - Any entry left in **Draft** or **Pending Approval** must be finalized before archiving.
2. **Generate and Distribute Payslips**
   - Confirm that all payslips have been created, submitted, and emailed.
   - If any payslip errors exist, correct underlying data, regenerate payslips, and redeploy before proceeding.

### Step 2: Archive Payroll Data

1. **Archive Payroll Entries**
   - In each submitted **Payroll Entry**, click `Menu > Mark as Closed` (or **Paid**) to lock records from further edits.
   - This ensures no accidental changes are made to historical data.
2. **Store Bank Transfer Files**
   - After salary disbursement, download the bank transfer CSV or confirmation PDF and attach it to the **Payroll Entry** under **Attachments**.
   - This file acts as proof of payment and should be retained alongside the payroll entry.
3. **Archive Payslip PDFs**
   - Navigate to `HR > Salary Slip > Salary Slip List`, filter by the payroll period, and click **Download Payslips** to retrieve all PDFs in a ZIP.
   - Save that ZIP in a secure shared folder (e.g., “`Payroll Archive > 2025 > July`”).
   - In the CGIC App, attach summary reports or the ZIP file itself to a custom doctype (e.g., “Payroll Archive”) if you prefer centralized retrieval.

### Step 3: Maintain Audit Trails

1. **Enable Audit Logging**
   - Under `Setup > System Settings`, verify that **Track Changes** is enabled for both **Payroll Entry** and **Salary Slip** doctypes.
   - This ensures every create/edit/submit action is logged with timestamp and user.
2. **View History When Needed**
   - To inspect a record’s change log, open a specific **Payroll Entry** or **Salary Slip** and click `Menu > View History.`
   - Use **Show Changes** to compare field values over time (e.g., see when deduction rates or net pay were altered).
3. **Record Manual Adjustments**
   - If post-closure adjustments are required (e.g., a retroactive pay correction), create a **Post-Payroll Adjustment Entry** under `HR > Payroll Adjustment.`
   - In the entry, reference the original **Payroll Period** and explain the reason. The CGIC App logs this as a separate journal.

### Step 4: Secure and Backup Payroll Records

1. **Set Permissions**
   - Under `Setup > Permission Manager`, ensure only **Payroll Manager**, **Accounts Manager**, and **System Manager** roles have **Read/Write** on payroll doctypes.
   - Restrict **Employee Self-Service** to **Read Only (own payslip)** so employees cannot modify historical data.
2. **Export for Offsite Backup**
   - Periodically (e.g., quarterly), export all payroll data:
     - **Payroll Entry**: CSV or JSON via `Menu > Export.`
     - **Salary Slip**: Bulk‐download as ZIP.
   - Store these exports in a secure offsite repository (cloud storage or an encrypted network share) to guard against data loss.
3. **Perform Regular Data Integrity Checks**
   - Every six months, run a **Payroll Reconciliation Report** comparing totals from CGIC App against your accounting system.
   - Identify and address any discrepancies promptly to prevent audit issues.

### Step 5: Retrieve Historical Payroll Records

1. **Use List Filters to Locate Old Payrolls**
   - In `HR > Payroll Entry > Payroll Entry List`, remove default filters, then sort by **Payroll Period** or **Status** to display closed records.
   - Apply filters such as **Period = “March 2024”** to narrow the search.
2. **Query Salary Slips by Employee**
   - In `HR > Salary Slip > Salary Slip List,` filter by **Employee** and **Period Range** to view that employee’s payslips across multiple cycles.
   - Export the filtered list to CSV if you need a consolidated view.
3. **Generate Historical Reports**
   - Under `HR > Reports > Payroll Register Report`, set the date range to include past periods (e.g., January–December 2023).
   - Click **Refresh** to compile a full year report, then export to PDF or CSV for analysis or submission.
