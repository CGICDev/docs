</Info>

### Step 1: Identify the Audit Period

1. **Determine Start and End Dates**
   - Confirm the exact dates auditors need (e.g., **January 1, 2025 – December 31, 2025**).
   - Note any mid‐period adjustments (retroactive pay, loan corrections) so you include them separately.
2. **List Relevant Payroll Entries**
   - Go to `HR > Payroll Entry > Payroll Entry List.`
   - Filter by **Start Date ≥** audit start and **End Date ≤** audit end.
   - Confirm all entries in that range have status **Closed/Paid**.

### Step 2: Export the Payroll Register Report

1. **Navigate to Payroll Register Report**
   - Go to `HR > Reports > Payroll Register Report.`
2. **Apply Date Filters**
   - Set **From Date =** audit start (e.g., 2025-01-01).
   - Set **To Date =** audit end (e.g., 2025-12-31).
   - (Optional) Filter by **Department** or **Cost Center** if auditors request segmentation.
3. **Refresh and Review**
   - Click **Refresh**. The report displays each **Payroll Entry** and associated salary components, including gross, deductions, and net pay for every employee.
4. **Export to CSV and PDF**
   - Click `Menu > Export > CSV` to download a detailed spreadsheet.
   - Click `Menu > Export > PDF` to generate a formatted version for auditors.

### Step 3: Export Individual Payslips (Optional)

1. **Download Payslips in Bulk**
   - Navigate to `HR > Salary Slip > Salary Slip List.`
   - Filter by **Payroll Entry Date ≥** audit start and **Payroll Entry Date ≤** audit end.
   - Click **Download Payslips**. The CGIC App packages all payslip PDFs into a ZIP file.
2. **Verify File Completeness**
   - Extract the ZIP locally and confirm every employee’s payslip for each payroll period is present.
   - Check for file naming conventions (e.g., “SL-2025-01-EMP1023.pdf”) for easy reference.

### Step 4: Export Deduction and Contribution Reports

1. **Deduction Register Report**
   - Go to `HR > Reports > Deduction Register Report.`
   - Filter by **Period ≥** audit start and **Period ≤** audit end.
   - Click **Refresh**, then `Export > CSV` and `Export > PDF`.
   - This shows every deduction type (tax, pension, loans) per employee, per period.
2. **Contribution Report**
   - Navigate to `HR > Reports > Contribution Report` (if configured).
   - Set the same date range.
   - Export to CSV/PDF and include employer and employee contributions (social security, health insurance, etc.).

### Step 5: Export Journal Entries or GL Report

1. **Accounting Journal Report**
   - Go to `Accounts > Reports > General Ledger.`
   - Filter by **Account** = “Salary Expense,” “Deductions Payable,” “Employer Contributions,” etc.
   - Set **From Posting Date =** audit start; **To Posting Date =** audit end.
   - Click **Refresh**, then `Export > CSV` and `Export > PDF`.
2. **Payroll Journal Entry List**
   - In `Accounts > Journal Entry > List`, filter by **Reference = Payroll Entry** and date range.
   - Export matching entries that debit salary expense and credit payables or cash disbursement.
