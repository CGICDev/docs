### Step 1: Define Salary Structures and Components

1. Navigate to` HR > Salary Component > Salary Component List.`
2. Ensure all required components are defined with correct **Component Type** (Earning or Deduction) and **Computation Formula** (if based on percentage or fixed amount).
3. Click `HR > Salary Structure > Salary Structure List`, then **New** to create a structure:
   - **Salary Structure Name**: e.g., “Engineer - Grade A.”
   - **Employee or Employee Group**: link to individual or group (e.g., “Engineers”).
   - In the **Earnings** section, add rows for each component (Basic, HRA, etc.), specifying amount or percentage of Basic.
   - In the **Deductions** section, add rows for PF, tax, or other deductions.
4. Click **Save**, then **Submit**. The structure can now be assigned to employees.

### Step 2: Assign Salary Structures to Employees

1. Go to `HR > Employee > Employee List.  `
2. Open an employee’s record and click **Edit**.
3. In the **Payroll Settings** section:
   - **Salary Structure**: select the appropriate structure (e.g., “Engineer - Grade A”).
   - **Payment Days Per Month**: typically “26” or “30” depending on policy.
   - **Bank Account**: select the default account for net pay disbursement.
4. Click **Save**. Repeat for all employees.

### Step 3: Capture Attendance and Leave Data

1. Ensure all attendance records for the month are submitted:
   - Navigate to `HR > Attendance > Attendance List.`
   - Verify that any absences, overtime, or irregularities are correctly recorded.
2. Confirm leaves taken are approved and reflected under `HR > Leave Application > Leave Application List.  `
3. If using biometric or third-party attendance integration, sync data before proceeding.

<Tip>
  Use `HR > Leave Balance Report` to confirm leave balances and handle encashment or unpaid leave deductions.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Generate a Monthly Payroll Entry

1. Navigate to `HR > Payroll > Payroll Entry > New Payroll Entry. `
2. In the **Payroll Entry** form:
   - **Fiscal Year**: e.g., “2024-2025.”
   - **Month**: select the month for processing (e.g., “June 2025”).
   - **Company**: choose your entity (e.g., “Charisma Global Industrial Co.”).
   - **Payroll Date**: defaults to the last day of the month; adjust if needed.
3. Click **Get Employees**. CGIC fetches all active employees with assigned salary structures.
4. In the **Salary Slip** table, each row shows:
   - **Employee** name and **Employee ID**.
   - **Salary Structure**.
   - **Gross Pay** (sum of all earnings).
   - **Total Deductions** (PF, tax, etc.).
   - **Net Pay** (Gross − Deductions).
5. Review each line for correctness. If any anomalies appear (e.g., zero net pay or negative), click that row to open the individual **Salary Slip** and adjust salary components, leave deductions, or allowances.
6. Once satisfied, click **Save** to retain the draft payroll. Then click **Submit** to finalize:
   - CGIC creates individual **Salary Slip** documents for each employee.
   - Payroll journal entries post:
     - **Debit**: Payroll Expense accounts (Basic, HRA, etc.).
     - **Credit**: Payroll Liability accounts (PF Payable, Tax Payable).
     - **Credit**: Bank or Cash account for total Net Pay.

### Step 5: Disburse Net Pay to Employees

1. After **Submitting** the Payroll Entry, navigate to `HR > Payroll > Payment Reconciliation.`
2. In the **Payment Reconciliation** tool:
   - Select the **Journal Entry** created by the payroll (e.g., “Payroll-Jun-2025”).
   - Click **Show Unreconciled Entries** to list net pay credits for employees.
   - Select all net pay lines and click **Make Bank Entry**.
   - A **Bank Voucher** draft opens with all employee net pay amounts.
3. Verify bank details one last time. Click **Save**, then **Submit** to record the bank transaction.
   - Funds are considered disbursed on this date.
   - Employee salary advances are reduced, and bank balance updates.

### Step 6: Deliver Payslips to Employees

1. In `HR > Payroll > Salary Slip List`, filter by **Month = June 2025** and **Status = “Paid”**.
2. Click `Download > PDF` to export all payslips as a consolidated PDF.
3. Email or upload to the employee portal:
   - Click **Send Email** in the Payroll Entry or Salary Slip list, selecting the template “Salary Slip Email.”
   - CGIC sends individual payslips to each employee’s registered email.
4. Confirm receipt by checking the **Email Queue** under `Settings > Email Account` for any bounce or failure notifications.
