<Info>
  Prerequisite

  - Employees have active salary structures, and a Payroll Entry exists (Draft or Submitted) for the current period.
  - All one-time deduction entries are in Submitted status, and recurring deductions are active.
  - Tax and pension percentages are up to date under `Setup > Payroll Settings.`
</Info>

### Step 1: Open the Payroll Entry

1. **Navigate to Payroll Entry List**
   - Go to `HR > Payroll Entry > Payroll Entry List.`
   - Select the payroll period (e.g., “July 2025”) in Draft or Submitted status.
2. **Open the Entry**
   - Click its name (e.g., “PR-2025-07”) to view details.

### Step 2: Review Deductions on Payslips

1. **Scroll to Employee Grid**
   - In the Payroll Entry, locate each employee’s row with columns for Gross Pay, Deductions, and Net Pay.
2. **Expand an Employee Detail**
   - Click the “\+” icon next to a name to see:
     - **Deduction Type** (e.g., “Tax,” “Loan Repayment”).
     - **Amount** (fixed or percentage-based).
     - **Status** (e.g., Submitted, Pending).
3. **Verify Automatic Calculations**
   - Confirm fixed deductions match entries and percentage deductions follow `(Percentage ÷ 100) × Gross Pay`.

### Step 3: Manually Adjust Deductions (If Needed)

1. **Edit Payslip Line**
   - Click the **Edit** icon on an employee’s row to open their payslip details.
2. **Override or Add Deduction**
   - To correct a value, update the **Amount** field directly.
   - To add a missing deduction, click **\+ Add Row**, select the **Deduction Type**, and enter the amount or percentage.
   - Include a brief **Comment** (e.g., “Adjust loan repayment as negotiated”).
3. **Remove an Erroneous Deduction**
   - Click the **Delete** (trash) icon beside the unwanted deduction line.
4. **Save Changes**
   - Click **Save** to update that employee’s deductions; the grid will refresh totals.

### Step 4: Recalculate Net Pay

1. **Click “Recalculate”**
   - After any changes, click **Recalculate** at the top of the Payroll Entry.
   - The system updates **Net Pay** = **Gross Pay** − **Sum of Deductions** for all employees.
2. **Review Aggregate Totals**
   - Compare **Total Deductions** with the **Payroll Summary Report** to ensure consistency.

### Step 5: Finalize Payslips

1. **Submit or Approve**
   - If in Draft, click **Submit**. If approval is required, it moves to **Pending Approval**, then click **Approve** when ready.
2. **Generate Payslips**
   - Once approved, click **Create Payslips** (if not auto-generated) to produce individual **Salary Slip** records including all deductions.
3. **Email Payslips**
   - Use **Email Payslips** to send each employee their PDF, clearly showing all deductions.
