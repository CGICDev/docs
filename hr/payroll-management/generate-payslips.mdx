  Prerequisites

  - A Payroll Entry (e.g., “August 2025”) must be in **Submitted** status under `HR > Payroll Entry > Payroll Entry List.`


  - A payslip print format exists under `Setup > Print Format > Salary Slip.`
  - **E**ach employee’s **Work Email** field is populated if you plan to email payslips.
</Info>

### Step 1: Open the Submitted Payroll Entry

1. **Navigate to Payroll Entry List**
   - Go to `HR > Payroll Entry > Payroll Entry List.`
   - Filter by **Status = Submitted** and select your period (e.g., “PR-2025-08”).
2. **Open the Entry**
   - Click the entry name to view the payroll details and confirm all earnings and deductions are correct.

### Step 2: Create Payslips in Bulk

1. **Click “Create Payslips”**
   - Within the Payroll Entry, click the **Create Payslips** button (usually in the top toolbar).
   - The system will generate a **Salary Slip** record for each active employee included in that payroll.
2. **Monitor Progress**
   - A progress bar appears as payslips are generated.
   - Once complete, each employee’s **Salary Slip** will have **Status = Draft** initially (unless auto‐submitted).
3. **Review Generated Payslips (Optional)**
   - Click **View Payslips** to open a list of all slips for that period.
   - Spot‐check a few payslips by clicking the slug (e.g., “SL-2025-08-EMP1023”) to ensure amounts match the Payroll Entry.

### Step 3: Submit and Email Payslips

1. **Submit Payslips (If Draft)**
   - In `HR > Salary Slip > Salary Slip List`, filter by **Status = Draft** and **Payroll Entry = [Your Period]**.
   - Select all drafts and click **Submit** to finalize each payslip. Submission locks amounts and marks them ready for distribution.
2. **Email Payslips to Employees**
   - Within the Payroll Entry, click **Email Payslips**.
   - Choose an email template (e.g., “Monthly Payslip Notification”).
   - Confirm sender address and click **Send**. The CGIC App emails each employee their PDF payslip.
3. **Verify Delivery**
   - Check the **Email Queue** (under `Setup > Email Queue`) for any failed deliveries.
   - Correct invalid email addresses in employee profiles and resend as needed.
