<Info>
  **Prerequisites**

  - The employee exists under `HR > Employee > Employee List.`
  - A **Salary Structure** is assigned to the employee under `HR > Salary Structure,` ensuring the system can compute gross pay.


  - **Deduction Types Configured**
    - Under `HR > Deduction Type` (or `Setup > Deduction Type`), confirm you have entries like:
      - **Statutory Tax**
      - **Pension Contribution**
      - **Health Insurance**
      - **Loan Repayment**
      - **Salary Advance**
    - If a needed type is missing, click **New** in **Deduction Type** and define:
      - **Name** (e.g., “Tax Withholding 2025”)
      - **Category** (Statutory, Voluntary, Company-Provided)
      - **Calculation Method** (Fixed Amount, Percentage of Gross, or Custom formula).
  - **Payroll Period and Settings**
    - Ensure the **Payroll Period** (e.g., May 2025) is open under `HR > Payroll Entry > Payroll Period List.`
    - If deductions are salary-slab based (percentage tiers), confirm your **Payroll Settings** in `Setup > Payroll Settings` reflect applicable slabs and tax rules.

### Steps to Record a One-Time Deduction

**Step 1: Navigate to Employee Deduction Entry**

1. **Go to Deduction Entry List**
   - In the CGIC App sidebar, click `HR > Deduction Entry > Deduction Entry List.`
   - This view shows all existing deduction entries (one-time and recurring).
2. **Click “New”**
   - In the top-right corner, click **New** to open a blank **Deduction Entry** form.

**Step 2: Fill in Deduction Details**

1. **Select Employee**
   - In the **Employee** field, search for and select the employee (e.g., “EMP-1023 – Jane Doe”).
2. **Enter Payroll Period**
   - In **Payroll Period**, choose the relevant month/period (e.g., “May 2025”).
   - The CGIC App uses this period to calculate net pay for that cycle.
3. **Choose Deduction Type**
   - In **Deduction Type**, pick from the dropdown (e.g., “Loan Repayment”).
   - The linked **Deduction Type** determines how the amount is processed (fixed or percentage).
4. **Specify Amount or Percentage**
   - If the Deduction Type is **Fixed Amount**, enter the **Amount** (e.g., ₦50,000).
   - If it’s **Percentage of Gross**, enter the **Percentage** (e.g., 5%). The system calculates the deduction based on the employee’s gross pay for that period.
5. **Set Start and End Dates** (for recurring deductions)
   - If this is a one-time deduction, leave **End Date** blank (the system processes it once).
   - For recurring entries (e.g., “Salary Advance — 6 Months”), set:
     - **Start Date**: First deduction month (e.g., 2025-05-01).
     - **End Date**: Last deduction month (e.g., 2025-10-31).
   - The CGIC App automatically posts the amount each month until the end date.
6. **Add Reference or Notes**
   - In **Reference** (optional), link to a supporting document (e.g., “Loan Agreement #LA-2025-045”).
   - Use **Notes** to record any additional context (e.g., “₦300,000 loan disbursed on 2025-04-15; repayment over 6 months”).
7. **Save & Submit**
   - Click **Save** to validate fields.
   - If no errors appear, click **Submit**.
   - The deduction entry status becomes **Submitted**, and the CGIC App logs who created it and when.

**Step 3: Review and Approve Deduction (If Approval Workflow Applies)**

1. **Check Status**
   - After submission, the **Deduction Entry** status may be **Pending Approval** if your CGIC App has an approval workflow for certain deduction types (e.g., loans over a threshold).
2. **Open the Entry and Click “Approve”**
   - As a **Payroll Manager** or designated approver, navigate to **Deduction Entry List**, filter by **Status = Pending Approval**.
   - Click the relevant entry, review details, and click **Approve**.
   - Approval routes the entry to **Approved** status; it’s now ready to be included in the next payroll run.
3. **Reject or Refer Back** (Optional)
   - If information is incomplete, click **Refer Back** with comments so the creator can correct.
   - If a deduction is unauthorized, click **Reject**—the entry moves to **Cancelled** status.

## Steps to Record Recurring Deductions

**Step 1: Create a Recurring Deduction Schedule**

1. **Go to Recurring Deductions**
   - In the CGIC App sidebar, click `HR > Recurring Deduction > Recurring Deduction List.`
   - This area defines multi-month or continuous deductions (e.g., monthly pension, health insurance).
2. **Click “New”**
   - Open a blank **Recurring Deduction** form.
3. **Fill in Recurring Deduction Details**
   - **Employee**: Select the employee.
   - **Deduction Type**: Choose the type (e.g., “Pension Contribution”).
   - **Start Date**: First payroll period to deduct (e.g., 2025-01-01).
   - **Frequency**: Set to **Monthly** (default) or another cadence if needed.
   - **Amount** or **Percentage**:
     - For fixed: enter the amount per month.
     - For percentage: enter percentage of gross pay.
   - **End Date**: When the deduction should automatically stop (e.g., 2050-12-31 or leave blank for indefinite).
4. **Save & Submit**
   - Click **Save**, then **Submit**.
   - The system schedules deduction entries automatically each period without manual intervention.

**Step 2: Monitor Scheduled Deductions**

1. **View Recurring Deduction Status**
   - In **Recurring Deduction List**, status shows **Active** or **Expired**.
   - **Active** means the schedule is still in effect; **Expired** means the End Date has passed.
2. **Edit or Cancel a Recurring Deduction**
   - To change the schedule (amount, percentage, end date), open the record and click **Edit** (if still a draft) or **Amend** (if already submitted).
   - After making changes, click **Save** and **Submit**.
   - To stop a recurring deduction prematurely, click **Cancel**. That stops future postings but retains history of deductions already processed.
3. **Review Deduction Ledger**
   - When payroll runs, check **Payroll Entry ▶️ Payroll Entry List** for each period to confirm the deduction was applied under **Deductions** section of the payslip.
   - If a deduction didn’t post, verify the recurring schedule’s **Start Date**, **End Date**, and **Frequency**.

**Step 3: Include Deductions in Payroll Run**

1. **Run Payroll for the Period**
   - Navigate to `HR > Payroll Entry > New.`
   - Select **Employee**, **Payroll Period**, and verify all earnings and allowances appear correctly.
2. **Scroll to Deductions Section**
   - Under **Deductions**, you’ll see:
     - **One-Time Deductions**: those recorded manually under **Deduction Entry**.
     - **Recurring Deductions**: automatically pulled from **Recurring Deduction** schedules.
     - **Statutory Deductions**: like tax, if your payroll settings generate them based on salary slabs.
3. **Verify Deduction Amounts**
   - Check each deduction line: **Deduction Type**, **Amount**, and **Status** (e.g., Pending, Approved).
   - If a deduction is missing or incorrect, update the underlying **Deduction Entry** or **Recurring Deduction** before finalizing payroll.
4. **Submit Payroll Entry**
   - Click **Save**, then **Submit**. The CGIC App:
     - Calculates **Net Pay** = Gross Pay − Total Deductions.
     - Posts accounting entries (Debit Salary Expense, Credit Deductions Payable or Cash/Bank for net payout).
   - Download or email payslips to employees that display detailed deduction breakdowns.
