  **Prerequisites**

  - At least one Employee record must already be created under `HR > Employee > Employee List.`
  - Know at least one unique identifier for the employee you’re looking for—such as Employee Code, Name, or Email—so you can perform an efficient search.
</Info>

### Step 1: Open the Employee List

1. **Navigate to Employee List**
   - In the CGIC App sidebar, click `HR > Employee > Employee List.`
   - This brings up a table of all active employees by default.
2. **Familiarize Yourself with the Toolbar**
   - At the top of the list, you’ll see:
     - A **Search Bar** (magnifying glass icon) for quick keyword searches.
     - **Filter** and **Sort** icons for advanced querying.
     - **Column Settings** (gear icon) to show/hide fields.

### Step 2: Perform a Quick Search

1. **Enter a Keyword**
   - Click the **Search Bar** and type in:
     - **Employee Name** (partial or full, e.g., “Ade” to find “Ademola Akin”).
     - **Employee Code** (e.g., “CGIC-EMP-1023”).
     - **Email** (e.g., “[jane.doe@cgic.com](mailto:jane.doe@cgic.com)”).
   - Press **Enter** or click the magnifying glass.
2. **Review Results**
   - The list filters instantly to show matching records.
   - Columns displayed—like Employee Code, Name, Department, Status—help you confirm you found the right person at a glance.
3. **Refine with Wildcards (Optional)**
   - You can use wildcard characters to broaden your search:
     - Typing “\*doe” finds any last name ending in “doe.”
     - Typing “ade\*” finds “Adebola,” “Ademola,” etc.

### Step 3: Apply Advanced Filters

1. **Open Filter Panel**
   - Click the **Filter** icon (funnel) at the top of the Employee List.
2. **Add Filter Conditions**
   - Click **\+ Add Filter** to choose a field and operator. Common filters include:
     - **Department =** e.g., “Production”
     - **Branch =** e.g., “Lagos Plant”
     - **Designation =** e.g., “Senior Engineer”
     - **Status =** e.g., “Active” or “On Leave”
   - Combine multiple filters to narrow down results (e.g., Department = “Finance” and Status = “Active”).
3. **Use Date Filters**
   - If you want to find employees who joined within a timeframe, add:
     - **Date of Joining ≥** “2025-01-01”
     - **Date of Joining ≤** “2025-05-31”
   - This returns all employees whose start date falls between these two dates.
4. **Filter by Custom Fields**
   - If your HR configuration includes custom fields—like **Cost Center** or **Grade Level**—you can add filters for those as well.
5. **Click “Apply”**
   - The CGIC App refreshes the list based on your filter criteria.

### Step 4: Sort and Rearrange Columns

1. **Sort by Column**
   - Click on any column header—such as **Employee Code**, **Name**, **Department**, or **Date of Joining**—to toggle ascending/descending order.
   - For example, clicking **Date of Joining** once sorts the newest hires to the top; clicking again reverses it.
2. **Show or Hide Columns**
   - Click the **Column Settings** (gear) icon.
   - Check or uncheck fields you want to see in the list, such as **Gender**, **Designation**, **Work Email**, or **Mobile Phone**.
   - This helps you surface the key information you need for quick scanning (e.g., show “Reporting Manager” if you often manage approvals).
3. **Resize Columns**
   - Hover over a column border until you see the resize cursor, then click and drag to adjust width.

### Step 5: Use the Global Search (Optional)

1. **Initiate Global Search**
   - Instead of navigating through menus, click the **Global Search** bar at the very top of the CGIC App (usually in the header).
   - Start typing the employee’s name, code, or email—global search will suggest matching employee records instantly.
2. **Select From Suggestions**
   - When you see the correct employee appear in the dropdown (e.g., “Ademola Akin (CGIC-EMP-1050)”), click it.
   - The system takes you directly to that employee’s profile, bypassing the list view.

### Step 6: Export Search Results (If Needed)

1. **Export to CSV**
   - After applying your search or filters, click `Menu > Export` (found in the top-right of the list).
   - Choose **CSV**. The system will prompt you to confirm which columns to include—select the ones you need (e.g., Employee Code, Name, Department, Designation, Status).
   - Click **Download** to save the CSV for your records or further analysis.
2. **Export to PDF (Optional)**
   - If you need a static snapshot for printing or sharing, click `Menu > Export` and select **PDF**.
   - The CGIC App generates a formatted PDF of your current list view, including headers and applied filters.
