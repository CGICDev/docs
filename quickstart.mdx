### 1. Manage Products

From raw materials to finished goods, the Products module lets you:

- Define and categorize every item with SKUs, UoMs, and vendor links
- Set and update pricing, cost, and default warehouses in one place
- Track stock movements—receipts, issues, transfers—so you always know what’s on hand

### 2. Manage HR

Keep your workforce running smoothly with the Employee Management suite:

- Onboard new hires by capturing biodata, documents, and salary structures
- Update profiles, change roles, and track employment status (active, on leave, terminated)
- Store and organize employee files, handle deductions, and integrate with Payroll

### 3. Manage Warehouse

Optimize your inventory flow from yard to delivery door:

- Record inbound receipts, assign bin locations, and reconcile stock levels
- Generate picking lists, ship orders, and track outbound transfers
- Automate inter-warehouse moves and leverage barcode/RFID scanning for accuracy

### 4. Manage Production

Turn demand into done with the Production Planning engine:

- Create multi-level Bills of Materials and manage version revisions
- Auto-generate and schedule work orders based on sales or forecast
- Monitor real-time production progress, record output, and calculate run costs

With these modules fully integrated, the CGIC App gives you a single source of truth—so you can make data-driven decisions, streamline processes, and keep every department in sync.
