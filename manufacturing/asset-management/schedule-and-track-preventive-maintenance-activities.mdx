<Card title="What it does" icon="sparkles" iconType="duotone">
  - Enables you to define equipment, maintenance activities, and checklists.
  - Automates generation of PM tasks based on frequency (hours, days, usage) or calendar dates.
  - Tracks task assignments, progress, and completion—logging all maintenance history automatically.
</Card>

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**

  - Equipment or machines are created under `Assets > Asset List`, with correct **Asset Code**, **Asset Name**, and **Location**.
  - If you’re using **Machines**, ensure they exist under `Manufacturing > Machine List`, with accurate **Machine Type**, **Capacity**, and **Location**.
  - Under `Setup > Maintenance Settings`, confirm that:
    - **Maintenance Statuses** (e.g., Planned, In Progress, Completed) are defined.
    - **Maintenance Priority** (e.g., High, Medium, Low) is set up if you need prioritization.
</Info>

### Step 1: Configure Maintenance Item and Checklist

1. **Define Maintenance Item**
   - Navigate to `Assets > Maintenance Item` (or `Maintenance > Maintenance Item`).
   - Click **New**.
   - Enter:
     - **Maintenance Item Name** (e.g., “Quarterly Lubrication – Conveyor Belt”).
     - **Related Asset** (select your equipment from Asset List).
     - **Maintenance Type**: Preventive.
     - **Frequency**: Set to **Time-based** (e.g., every 90 days) or **Usage-based** (e.g., every 500 operating hours).
   - Save the Maintenance Item.
2. **Create Maintenance Checklist**
   - In the Maintenance Item form, scroll to **Checklist**.
   - Click **\+ Add Row** for each task step:
     - **Task Description** (e.g., “Check belt tension,” “Inspect bearings for wear”).
     - **Expected Duration** (e.g., 30 minutes).
     - **Required Tools or Parts** (optional field).
   - Save the Checklist.

> Use a detailed checklist so technicians know exactly what to inspect, reducing the chance of skipped steps.

### Step 2: Set Up Preventive Maintenance Schedule

1. **Navigate to Preventive Maintenance**
   - Go to `Maintenance > Preventive Maintenance.`
   - Click **New**.
2. **Fill in Schedule Details**
   - **Subject**: Name your schedule (e.g., “Monthly Inspection – CNC Machine”).
   - **Asset / Machine**: Choose the asset or machine to maintain.
   - **Maintenance Item**: Select the item you configured in Step 1.
   - **Frequency**: Confirm or override the frequency (Time interval or Usage threshold).
   - **Start Date**: The first due date for the maintenance.
   - **End Date** (Optional): Define if this is a temporary/one-off schedule—leave blank for ongoing PM.
   - **Assign To**: Choose the default **Maintenance Technician** responsible (this can be adjusted per task later).
   - **Priority**: Select urgency (High, Medium, Low).
3. **Enable Auto-Generation**
   - Tick **“Auto Generate Tasks”** so the CGIC App will automatically create Maintenance Tasks when due.
   - Click **Save**.

> If your assets run 24/7 and you track usage, switch to a **Usage-based** frequency. For example, set “Every 500 run hours” and the CGIC App will generate tasks when the meter reading meets that criterion.

### Step 3: Assign and Manage Maintenance Tasks

1. **View Upcoming Tasks**
   - Go to `Maintenance > Maintenance Task > List.`
   - Filter by **Status: To Do** or **Planned** to see tasks generated by your schedules.
2. **Assign or Reassign Tasks**
   - Click on a task (e.g., **MT-2025-0150 – Monthly Inspection – CNC Machine**).
   - If needed, change **Assigned To** (choose another technician).
   - Check **Due Date** and **Priority**—adjust if production schedules shift.
   - Add any **Comments** or **Attachments** (e.g., photos of previous wear).
   - Click **Save**.
3. **Communicate the Schedule**
   - Use the **Email** or **Comment** feature to notify the technician of upcoming tasks.
   - Attach relevant SOPs or safety instructions in the task if special handling is needed.

### Step 4: Execute and Log Maintenance Activities

1. **Start the Maintenance Task**
   - Technician opens the Maintenance Task record.
   - Click **Start** (changes status to **In Progress**).
   - Work through each checklist item: tick off tasks, log any observations, note if spare parts were replaced.
2. **Record Meter Readings or Usage Data** (If Usage-Based)
   - In the task form, input the **Current Meter Reading** (e.g., machine run hours).
   - The CGIC App will calculate when the next task is due based on this reading.
3. **Capture Material Consumption**
   - Scroll to **Consumed Items**.
   - Click **\+ Add Row** to log any spare parts or lubricants used (e.g., 2L of hydraulic oil, 1 filter element).
   - Quantities are automatically deducted from the linked Warehouse inventory.
4. **Attach Evidence**
   - Use the **Attachments** section to upload photos of wear, replaced parts, or any anomalies found.
   - This provides historical context for future audits and troubleshooting.
5. **Complete the Task**
   - Once all checklist items are done, click **Complete**.
   - The CGIC App logs:
     - **Completion Date** and **Time**.
     - **Total Labor Hours** (if you track time spent).
     - **Next Due Date** (automatically calculated and scheduled if auto-generation is enabled).

<Tip>
  If you discover a critical issue during a routine check, update the Priority to High and notify the Maintenance Manager immediately for corrective action.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Review Maintenance History and Reports

1. **Review Individual Asset History**
   - Go to `Assets > Asset List`, open a specific asset (e.g., **Machine-01 – CNC Mill**).
   - Click the **Maintenance** tab to see all completed tasks, dates, and attached notes/photos.
   - Confirm that each PM was done on schedule—look for gaps or delays.
2. **Generate Maintenance Reports**
   - Navigate to `Maintenance > Reports > Maintenance Schedule Report:`
     - **Filter By**: Date Range, Asset, Maintenance Item, or Status.
     - Click **Refresh** to see pending vs. completed tasks.
     - Export to CSV/PDF for performance reviews or management presentations.
   - Go to `Maintenance > Reports > Maintenance History Report`:
     - Track actual execution dates versus planned dates.
     - Identify assets with frequent breakdowns or high part consumption—signals potential replacement or redesign.
3. **Analyze Cost and Downtime**
   - Use **Maintenance Cost Report** to see total cost per asset (labor \+ parts).
   - Compare across assets to identify outliers: if one machine’s PM costs spike, investigate for inefficiencies or recurring issues.
