<Card title="What it does:  " icon="sparkles" iconType="duotone">
  - Runs scheduled depreciation for each asset based on its category’s depreciation method (Straight Line or Reducing Balance).
  - Updates each asset’s **Accumulated Depreciation** and **Book Value** automatically.
  - Generates reports that display current asset values, depreciation schedules, and historical depreciation entries.
</Card>

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**

  - Asset records have been created under `Assets > Asset List` (with correct **Asset Cost** and **Purchase Date**).
  - Each asset is linked to an **Asset Category** under `Assets > Asset Category List`, with a defined **Depreciation Method** and **Useful Life (Months)**.
  - Depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation accounts are configured under `Accounts > Chart of Accounts. `
    - Cost Centers or Departments are defined if you need to allocate depreciation by location or business unit.
</Info>

### Step 1: Verify Asset and Category Settings

1. Navigate to `Assets > Asset Category List.`
2. For each category, confirm settings:
   - **Depreciation Method**: Straight Line or Reducing Balance.
   - **Useful Life (Months)**: the asset’s expected service duration.
   - **Salvage Value (%)**: the percentage of original cost remaining at end of useful life.
3. Click **Save** if you make any changes.

<Tip>
  If you need to change a depreciation method mid-life, create a new category version and reassign assets accordingly—maintaining historical accuracy.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Run Scheduled Depreciation

1. Navigate to `Assets > Depreciation > Run Depreciation.`
2. In the **Run Depreciation** dialog, set:
   - **Company**: your legal entity.
   - **Depreciation Date**: the date up to which depreciation should be calculated (e.g., month‐end).
   - **Asset Category** (Optional): limit depreciation to a specific category; leave blank to process all active categories.
3. Click **Run**. CGIC will:
   - Calculate depreciation for each qualifying asset based on its cost, accumulated depreciation, useful life, and method.
   - Post ledger entries:
     - **Debit** Depreciation Expense account.
     - **Credit** Accumulated Depreciation account.
   - Update each asset’s **Accumulated Depreciation** and **Book Value** fields.
4. Review the **Depreciation Ledger Entries** in the pop-up or under `Accounts > General Ledger` to ensure accuracy.

<Note>
  Schedule this process monthly or quarterly to align with your financial close cycle.
</Note>

### Step 3: Review Asset Book Value and Depreciation History

1. Go to `Assets > Asset List` and locate an asset you wish to inspect.
2. Click the asset’s **Asset Code** to open its profile.
3. In the **Financials** tab, review:
   - **Asset Cost** (original purchase price).
   - **Accumulated Depreciation** (to date).
   - **Book Value** (Cost − Accumulated Depreciation).
4. Click **Depreciation Schedule** (or **View Depreciation History**) to see a detailed list of all past depreciation entries:
   - **Date** of each run.
   - **Depreciation Amount** recorded.
   - **Ledger Entry Reference** (for audit linking).
5. If you need to correct a depreciation run (e.g., wrong date or amount), click `Actions > Reverse Depreciation` for that entry, then rerun depreciation with the correct parameters.

### Step 4: Run Asset Valuation Reports

1. Navigate to `Assets > Reports > Asset Register Report. `
2. In the filter panel, set:
   - **Company**: your legal entity.
   - **As on Date**: the date for book value reporting.
   - **Asset Category** or **Location** (Optional): narrow to a specific class or department.
3. Click **Refresh**. The report will show:
   - **Asset Code** and **Name**.
   - **Asset Cost**, **Accumulated Depreciation**, and **Book Value** as of the specified date.
   - **Depreciation for Period** (if you include a date range filter).
4. To analyze trends, export via `Download > CSV` and plot in your financial system or Excel.

<Note>
  Use this report during physical audits to reconcile recorded book values with floor inventory.
</Note>

### Step 5: Monitor Depreciation Over Multiple Periods

1. Click `Assets > Reports > Depreciation Schedule Report.  `
2. Set filters:
   - **From Date / To Date**: the range for which you want depreciation details (e.g., January–June 2025).
   - **Asset Category**: specific category or leave blank for all.
3. Click **Refresh**. The report displays:
   - **Asset Code** and **Name**.
   - **Depreciation Date** for each run.
   - **Depreciation Amount** posted each period.
   - **Book Value** after each run.
4. Analyze how cumulative depreciation evolves. Export to CSV or PDF for management review.

<Tip>
  Identify assets with accelerating depreciation (in Reducing Balance) versus straight‐line trends to inform replacement budgeting.
