title: "Generate reports on asset performance, maintenance, and costs"
description: "Unlock insights into how assets are performing, how maintenance activities are impacting uptime, and how expenses are distributed—so CGIC teams can make data-driven decisions using the CGIC App."

<Info>
  **Prerequisties**

  - Assets must be created under `Assets > Asset List` with correct details (Asset Code, Category, Location).
  - Maintenance Tasks (preventive and corrective) have been logged under `Maintenance > Maintenance Task`, and costs have been recorded per task.


  - **Cost Centers and Budgets Configured**
    - Under `Accounts > Chart of Accounts`, asset-related expense accounts are set up.
    - Cost centers are defined in `Accounts > Cost Center List`.
    - Budgets for maintenance and asset expenses have been created under `Accounts > Budget `(if you want budget vs. actual comparisons).

### Step 1: Access Asset Performance Reports

1. **Navigate to Asset Reports**
   - Go to **Assets ▶️ Reports ▶️ Asset Performance Report**.
   - This report shows metrics like:
     - **Uptime (%)** per asset—calculated as (Total Available Hours − Total Downtime) ÷ Total Available Hours.
     - **Utilization Rate**: Time asset was actually running versus idle.
     - **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: Average hours between failures.
     - **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)**: Average time to restore an asset to working condition.
2. **Filter and Customize**
   - In the filter panel, set:
     - **Date Range** (e.g., Jan 1, 2025 – May 31, 2025).
     - **Asset Category** or specific **Asset** names.
     - **Location** or **Cost Center** (if assets are grouped by plant or department).
   - Click **Refresh** to apply filters.
3. **Review Key Metrics**
   - Scan the table or chart for assets with:
     - Low **Uptime (%)**—indicates potential reliability issues.
     - High **MTTR**—suggests lengthy repairs or spare-parts shortages.
     - Low **Utilization**—maybe an asset is underused or scheduled work is inefficiently allocated.

> 🔍 _Tip:_ If you need to share these metrics with senior management, click **Export ▶️ CSV** or **Export ▶️ PDF** and include a brief narrative highlighting the top-performing and underperforming assets.

### 🔄 Step 2: Generate Maintenance Compliance and History Reports

1. **Maintenance Schedule Report**
   - Navigate to **Maintenance ▶️ Reports ▶️ Maintenance Schedule Report**.
   - Use filters such as:
     - **Status** (Planned, In Progress, Completed).
     - **Due Date Range** (e.g., May 1, 2025 – May 31, 2025).
     - **Asset** or **Maintenance Item**.
   - Click **Refresh** to view:
     - List of upcoming and overdue tasks.
     - For each task: Due Date, Assigned Technician, Priority, and Status.
2. **Maintenance History Report**
   - Go to **Maintenance ▶️ Reports ▶️ Maintenance History Report**.
   - Filter by:
     - **Asset**, **Date Range**, **Maintenance Item**, or **Technician**.
   - Click **Refresh** to see:
     - Completed tasks with actual completion dates.
     - Duration of each task.
     - Any recorded anomalies or component replacements.
3. **Compliance Metrics**
   - At the top of both reports, you’ll see summary figures such as:
     - **% On-Time Completion**: (Tasks Completed On or Before Due Date) ÷ (Total Tasks).
     - **Average Time over Due**: For tasks completed late, the average number of days overdue.

> 📈 _Tip:_ Monitor **% On-Time Completion** monthly. If it dips below, say, 90%, investigate whether staffing is insufficient or if certain assets need more frequent attention.

### 📈 Step 3: Run Cost Analysis Reports

1. **Asset Maintenance Cost Report**
   - Go to **Maintenance ▶️ Reports ▶️ Asset Maintenance Cost Report**.
   - Apply filters:
     - **Asset** (e.g., “Pump-03 – Cooling Tower Pump”).
     - **Date Range** (e.g., Fiscal Year 2025).
     - **Cost Center** (e.g., “Plant A – Production”).
   - Click **Refresh**. The report displays:
     - **Material Cost** (sum of all consumed items).
     - **Labor Cost** (sum of labor hours × rate).
     - **External Service Cost** (sum of linked Purchase Invoices).
     - **Total Maintenance Cost** per asset and aggregated by category.
2. **Asset Value and Expense Ledger**
   - Navigate to **Assets ▶️ Reports ▶️ Asset Value and Expense Ledger**.
   - Filter by **Asset** or **Cost Center**.
   - Click **Refresh** to view:
     - **Acquisition Cost** and **Capitalization Date**.
     - **Cumulative Maintenance Costs**.
     - **Accumulated Depreciation** to date.
     - **Book Value** over time.
   - Scroll horizontally to see how each cost element contributes to total asset cost.
3. **Budget vs. Actual Report**
   - Under **Accounts ▶️ Budget ▶️ Budget vs Actual Report**, set:
     - **Fiscal Year** (e.g., 2025–2026).
     - **Cost Center** (e.g., “Maintenance – Plant B”).
     - **Expense Account** (e.g., “Maintenance Expense – Equipment”).
   - Click **Refresh** to see:
     - **Budgeted Amount** versus **Actual Expense** month by month.
     - **Variance** and **% Utilization** of budget.

> 📊 _Note:_ If you spot a big variance—actuals exceeding budget—click the **GL Entries** link (if available) to drill down into specific journal entries for root-cause analysis.

### 🔧 Step 4: Build Custom Dashboards

1. **Create a New Dashboard**
   - In the CGIC App’s sidebar, click **Desk ▶️ Dashboard ▶️ New**.
   - Name it something like “Asset Performance & Cost Overview.”
2. **Add Widgets**
   - Click **\+ Add Widget** and choose from:
     - **Report Chart** (e.g., pie chart of maintenance costs by department).
     - **Number Card** (e.g., “Total Maintenance Cost This Month”).
     - **Heatmap** (e.g., asset uptime over the last 12 months).
   - Configure each widget by selecting the relevant report and filters (e.g., Asset Category = “CNC Machines”).
   - Arrange widgets for at-a-glance clarity.
3. **Share the Dashboard**
   - Click **Share** and choose roles or specific users (e.g., Asset Managers, Plant Supervisors).
   - They’ll see real-time data every time they log in to the CGIC App.

> 🔍 _Tip:_ Keep your dashboard uncluttered—limit to 4–6 key widgets so stakeholders can quickly grasp performance and cost trends.
