title: "List Raw Materials Required for Production with specified quantities"
description: "Quickly generate a list of all raw materials needed to manufacture a given quantity of a finished product—complete with exact component amounts—so you can plan procurement and production efficiently in the CGIC App."

<Info>
  Prerequisites

  - The finished‐goods item has an active, submitted BOM under `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List.` 

  - All component items (raw materials) in that BOM are set up as “Stock Items” under `Stock > Item > Item List.`

  - Warehouses for raw materials and production (e.g., “Raw Material Store”, “Work‐In‐Progress”) are defined under `Stock > Warehouse.`
</Info>

### 1.0 Open a New Material Request for Manufacturing

1. Navigate to `Stock > Material Request > New Material Request.`  

2. In the “New Material Request” form, set:  

   - **Request Type**: select **“Manufacture”**.  

   - **Company**: choose your legal entity (e.g., Charisma Global).  

   - **Purpose**: should read **“Manufacture”** automatically when Request Type is “Manufacture.”  

   - **From Warehouse**: choose the warehouse where raw materials are pulled from (e.g., “Raw Material Store”).  

   - **Project** or **Cost Center**: (optional) assign if you track production costs to a specific project or department.  

3. Click **Save** to draft the request.

### 1.1 Link the BOM and Specify Production Quantity

1. In the Material Request form, locate the **Work Order** field near the top (if you have an existing Work Order).  

   - If you are using a Work Order, select it and skip ahead to Step 3.  

   - Otherwise, leave **Work Order** blank and focus on **BOM**.

2. In the **BOM** field, click the lookup (🔍) and select the BOM corresponding to your finished‐goods item (e.g., **BOM‐Danaval‐Chocolate‐001**).  

3. In the **Quantity** field (immediately to the right of the BOM), enter the number of finished units you plan to produce (e.g., **500 Loaves**).  

4. CGIC automatically scales each component in the **Items** grid based on the BOM’s default “Quantity to Manufacture” and your specified quantity.  

5. Verify that each component row now displays:  

   - **Item Code** (raw material)  

   - **Required Qty** (calculated quantity needed for 500 units)  

   - **UOM** (e.g., “Kg”, “Nos”)  

   - **Warehouse** (source location for that raw material)  

6. Click **Save**. The system has now exploded the BOM and listed all raw materials with exact quantities required.

### 1.2 Review and Adjust (If Necessary)

1. Scroll through the **Items** table in the Material Request. Confirm that each raw material’s **Required Qty** matches your expectations.  

2. If a component is consumed at a different rate (e.g., if you decided to produce only 450 units instead of 500), simply update the **Quantity** field at the top and click **Fetch Items** again.  

3. If any raw material needs to come from a different warehouse—click its **Warehouse** cell in the row and select the correct location.  

4. For non-stock items or manually provided services, change the **Item Code** cell to a free-text description (if your BOM includes services under “Consumables”).  

### -1.3 Submit Material Request (Optional)

<Tip>
   _If your goal is purely to list materials,_ you can stop after Step 3. But if you want to reserve stock or trigger purchasing, follow these additional steps:
</Tip>

1. In the Material Request form, change **Status** from **Draft** to **Submitted** by clicking **Submit**.  

2. CGIC automatically creates “Requested” stock reservations for each raw material in the specified warehouse.  

3. If any raw material quantity cannot be fulfilled from existing stock, CGIC flags it as **“Open”** under the **Balance Qty** column.  

4. To procure missing items, click `Create > Purchase Order` from the MR toolbar. CGIC generates a draft PO with all raw materials, their required quantities, and default suppliers pre-filled.  

5. Review the Purchase Order, then click **Submit** to send to your vendor—and rest assured that your production run has all required materials planned.
