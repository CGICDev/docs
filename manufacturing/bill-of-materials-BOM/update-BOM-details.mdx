title: "Update BOM Details"
description: "Modify an existing Bill of Materials (BOM) to reflect changes in components, quantities, or operations—while preserving version history—using the CGIC App."

<Card title="Overview">
  **What it does:**  

  - Enables you to amend an active BOM without deleting it  

  - Creates a new version linked to the original, maintaining historical audit trails  

  - Allows updates to raw material quantities, component lists, operations, and attributes  
</Card>

<Info>
  Prerequisites  

  - The BOM you want to update is in **Submitted** (Active) status  

  - Raw materials, sub-assemblies, and workstations are configured under `Stock > Item and Manufacturing > Workstation`
</Info>

### 1.0 Locate and Open the Existing BOM

1. Navigate to `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List.`  

2. Use filters (e.g., **Item**, **BOM No.**, **Status = Submitted**) to find the BOM you need to update.  

3. Click the desired **BOM No.** to open its details.

### 2.0 Create an Amendment (New Version)

1. In the BOM form, click `Actions > Amend.`  

2. A new draft BOM opens, labeled “\*\*Amended from [Original BOM No.]\*\*.”  

3. The header will pre-populate with the original BOM’s details (Item, Quantity, UOM, etc.).  

4. Modify any header fields if needed (e.g., change **Applicable From** date to today).  

5. Click **Save** to prepare the amendment.

\> 💡 **Tip:** Use the **Applicable From** date to control when the new BOM version becomes effective.

### 🔍 Step 3: Update Materials (Components)

1. Scroll to the **Materials** table in the amended BOM.  

2. To **add** a new component:  

   - Click **Add Row**.  

   - Scan or type the **Item Code**, enter **Required Qty**, verify **UOM**, and confirm **Consumption Type** and **Warehouse**.  

3. To **remove** an existing component:  

   - Click the trash-can icon on the row.  

4. To **edit** a component’s quantity or details:  

   - Click the cell (e.g., **Required Qty**) and update the value.  

   - Change **Consumption Type** or **Warehouse** if needed.  

5. Repeat until all component changes are complete.  

6. Click **Save** to validate material updates.

\> 🔄 **Note:** If you change **Quantity to Manufacture**, CGIC auto-scales all component quantities accordingly.

### ⚙️ Step 4: Update Operations (Optional)

1. Scroll to the **Operations** table in the amended BOM.  

2. To **add** a new operation:  

   - Click **Add Row**.  

   - Enter **Operation Name**, select **Workstation**, specify **Time in Minutes**, and set **Sequence**.  

3. To **remove** an existing operation:  

   - Click the trash-can icon on the operation row.  

4. To **edit** an existing operation’s details:  

   - Click any cell (e.g., **Time in Minutes**) and update the value.  

   - Adjust **Sequence** if the step order has changed.  

5. Click **Save** once all operations reflect the new process.

\> 🔧 **Tip:** Ensure your sequence numbers remain contiguous (1, 2, 3…) to avoid workflow confusion.

### ▶️ Step 5: Review & Submit the Amended BOM

1. Scroll back to the top of the amended BOM form.  

2. Verify:  

   - **Header** fields (Item, Quantity, Applicable From date)  

   - **Materials** table entries (correct item codes and quantities)  

   - **Operations** (if included) are properly sequenced  

3. Click **Submit**.  

   - A new BOM version is created and marked **Active** as of the Applicable From date.  

   - The original BOM remains in the system as a historic version for reference.

\> 📑 **Tip:** After submission, CGIC assigns a new **Revision Number** (e.g., BOM-0001-02) to distinguish it from the original.
