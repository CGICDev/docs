title: "Update BOM Details"
description: "When your manufacturing process changes—whether you adjust component quantities, swap raw materials, or modify operations—you need to update the corresponding Bill of Materials (BOM) so that all future Work Orders use the correct recipe. Follow these steps to amend an existing BOM and create a new version in the CGIC App."

<Card title="Overview">
  **What it does:**

  - Opens an existing, submitted BOM (e.g., “BOM-Bottled Water-001”) and creates a new draft version
  - Allows you to update header fields (quantity, warehouse, cost center), adjust raw material lines, and change operation steps (e.g., “Filling & Sealing,” “Labelling”)
  - Links each update to the previous version—preserving historical records and version numbers
</Card>

<Info>
  Prerequisites

  - The BOM you want to update is already in **Submitted** (Active) status under `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List`
  - All raw materials and operations you need (e.g., “Filling & Sealing,” “Labelling”) are configured as stock items and workstations in the system
</Info>

### 1.0 Open the Active BOM

1. Navigate to `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List.`
2. Use the search bar or add filters—such as **Item = “Bottled Water”** or **BOM No. = “BOM-Bottled Water-001”**—to locate the BOM you want to update.
3. Click the BOM’s name (e.g., **BOM-Bottled Water-001**). This opens the BOM form in view mode, showing tabs like **Production Item**, **Operations**, **Scrap & Process Loss**, **Costing**, etc.

### 2.0 Create a New Version (Amendment)

1. In the BOM header (top-right), click **New Version**.
2. A dialog appears asking for the **Applicable From** date—enter the date when the updated BOM should go into effect (e.g., today’s date).
3. Click **OK**. A new draft BOM opens, prefixed with “\*\*Amended from BOM-Bottled Water-001\*\*.”
4. Immediately click **Save** (top-right) to lock in the new version number and enable editing of header, materials, and operations.

### 3.0 Update Header Fields (If Needed)

1. If your production batch size or warehouse changes, edit these fields:
   - **Quantity to Manufacture**: Adjust if your standard run size has changed.
   - **UOM**: Should remain the same (e.g., “Nos” or “Liters”), unless the fundamental unit has shifted.  \\
   - **Warehouse**: Change the source raw material warehouse if procurement locations have shifted.
   - **Manufacturing Cost Center**: Update if this BOM now ties to a different cost center.
2. Any change to **Quantity to Manufacture** will automatically scale all raw material quantities in the **Materials** table when you next save.

<Tip>
  If you only need to adjust operation times or add a new step, you can leave the header unchanged and move straight to the **Operations** tab.
</Tip>

### 4.0 Edit Operations (Using the “Operations” Tab)

1. Click the **Operations** tab (as shown in the screenshot). You’ll see a list of existing operation rows, each with columns:
   - **No.** (sequence number)
   - **Operation** (e.g., “Filling & Sealing,” “Labelling”)
   - **Workstation Type** (which machine or work center handles this step)
   - **Operation Time** (time in minutes per unit, e.g., 0.500)
   - **Fixed Time** (check if this step takes a flat time irrespective of quantity)
   - **Operating Cost (NGN)** (calculated or entered cost per operation)
2. To **add a new operation**:
   - Scroll to the bottom of the operations table and click **Add Row**.
   - Enter the next **No.** in sequence (e.g., if “Labeling” is No. 2, your new step becomes No. 3).
   - In **Operation**, type or select the new operation name (e.g., “Carton Packing”).
   - In **Workstation Type**, choose the appropriate workstation (e.g., “Packing Machine #2”).
   - Enter **Operation Time** (e.g., 0.100 minutes per unit) and check **Fixed Time** if the step is a fixed duration (e.g., 5 minutes per batch).
   - Optionally, adjust **Operating Cost (NGN)** if you track labor or machine cost directly in the BOM.
3. To **edit an existing operation** (e.g., change time for “Labelling”):
   - Click the cell under **Operation Time** (or **Workstation Type**, **Fixed Time**, **Operating Cost**) for that row.
   - Change the value as needed (for example, update “Labelling” time from **0.060** to **0.075** minutes per unit).
   - Press **Enter** or click outside the cell to confirm.
4. To **remove an operation**:
   - Check the box at the left of the row you want to delete.
   - Click the **trash-can icon** that appears at the top of the operations table.
   - Confirm the deletion if prompted.
5. Once all operation edits are complete, click **Save** to validate the changes.

### 5.0 Edit Material Components (If Also Changing Components)

1. Click the **Production Item** tab (or **Materials** table within the **Production Item** view).
2. To **add** a new raw material:
   - Click **Add Row** in the **Materials** table.
   - Select the **Item Code** (e.g., “Bottle Caps”), enter the **Required Qty** (e.g., 1 cap per bottle), verify **UOM**, set **Consumption Type** (e.g., “Mandatory”), and confirm the **Warehouse**.
3. To **edit** an existing component’s quantity:
   - Click the cell under **Required Qty** for that item and enter the new amount (e.g., increase “PET Bottles” from 1 to 1.1 bottles per unit if packaging changed).
   - If you updated **Quantity to Manufacture** in Step 3, click **Save** to auto-scale all component quantities proportionally.
4. To **remove** a component:
   - Check the box on the left of its row, then click the **trash-can icon** at the top of the materials table.
5. After adjusting components, click **Save** again to confirm.

### 6.0 Review & Submit the Amended BOM

1. Scroll back to the top of the BOM form to ensure:
   - Header fields reflect the intended changes (e.g., new quantity, warehouse).
   - The **Materials** table lists the correct raw materials and quantities.
   - The **Operations** table shows updated or newly added steps with correct timings and costs.
2. Click **Submit** at the top-right.
   - The amended BOM is now **Active**, replacing the previous version as of the **Applicable From** date you set.
   - CGIC will assign a new Revision Number (e.g., “BOM-Bottled Water-002”).
   - All future Work Orders will reference this version of the BOM.
