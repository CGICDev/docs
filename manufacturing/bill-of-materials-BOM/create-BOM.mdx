title: "Create BOM"
description: "Define the components, quantities, and steps needed to manufacture a finished good by creating a Bill of Materials (BOM) in the CGIC App—so production processes are standardized and inventory usage is accurate."
---

<Card title="Overview">
  **What it does:**

  - Establishes a structured list of raw materials, sub-assemblies, and operations required to produce a finished product
  - Records component quantities, UOMs, and optional operations/workstations in a single document
  - Drives Material Requirement Planning (MRP), production scheduling, and inventory reservation
</Card>

> Prerequisites
>
> - Finished goods and components are defined as “Stock Items” under `Stock > Item > Item List `
> - Warehouses for raw materials and finished goods are configured under `Stock > Warehouse`

### 1.0 Open the BOM List

1. From the home menu, navigate to `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List.`
2. Click **New** in the top-right to start a new BOM.

### 1.1 Populate BOM Header

1. **BOM No.**: Auto-generated by CGIC (you can override if needed using a custom naming series).
2. **Item**: Select the finished good you intend to manufacture (e.g., “Danaval Chocolate Bread”).
3. **BOM Type**: Choose one of:
   - **Manufacture** (for in-house production)
   - **Subcontract** (if a third party performs production)
4. **Quantity to Manufacture**: Enter the default quantity (e.g., 100 units). This determines component scaling.
5. **UOM**: Auto-populates based on the finished good’s default unit of measure (e.g., “Nos” or “Kg”).
6. **Applicable From**: (Optional) Set an effective date if this BOM replaces an older version.
7. **Warehouse**: Choose the source warehouse for raw materials (e.g., “Raw Material Store”).
8. **Manufacturing Cost Center**: (Optional) Assign a cost center if you track production costs by department.
9. **Save** to reserve the BOM number and enable component entry.

### 1.2 Add Raw Material Components

1. In the **Materials** table, click **Add Row**.
2. For each component, select:
   - **Item Code** (e.g., “Flour 50Kg Sack”) by scanning or typing.
   - **Required Qty** (quantity needed to produce the BOM quantity, e.g., 0.5 kg per loaf).
   - **UOM** (should match the component’s default unit).
   - **Consumption Type**: Choose either
     - **Mandatory** (must be consumed for every production run)
     - **By Product** (if the item is produced as a by-product)
   - **Warehouse** (source location for this component; auto-filled from header but override if needed).
3. Repeat for all raw materials and sub-assemblies required to produce the finished good.
4. Click **Save** to validate component totals.

<Note>
  CGIC will auto-calculate total component requirement if you change **Quantity to Manufacture** later.
</Note>

### 1.3 (Optional) Define Operations/Workstations

1. If your manufacturing process includes distinct steps, scroll to the **Operations** table.
2. Click **Add Row** for each operation:
   - **Operation Name** (e.g., “Mixing,” “Baking,” “Packaging”).
   - **Workstation** (select the shop floor location or machine where this operation occurs).
   - **Time in Minutes** (standard time to complete that operation per unit).
   - **Sequence** (enter 1 for first operation, 2 for second, etc.).
3. Repeat until all steps are defined in sequence.
4. Click **Save** again to lock in operations.

### 1.4 Review & Submit the BOM

1. Double-check header and tables to confirm:
   - **Finished Item** and **Quantity to Manufacture**
   - All **Materials** listed with accurate quantities and warehouses
   - Optional **Operations** are in correct sequence
2. Click **Submit** to finalize the BOM:
   - CGIC will mark the BOM as **Active**.
   - The BOM can now be used to create **Work Orders** or drive **Material Request** for raw materials.

> Creating a precise Bill of Materials in the CGIC App standardizes your manufacturing processes, automates raw material reservation, and ensures accurate costing. Once the BOM is active, you can seamlessly generate Work Orders, plan materials, and track production—enabling consistent, efficient, and auditable manufacturing operations.
