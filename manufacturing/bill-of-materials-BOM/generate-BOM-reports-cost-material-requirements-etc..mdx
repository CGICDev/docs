### 1.0 Access the Manufacturing Reports Menu

1. From the main menu, navigate to `Manufacturing > Reports.`
2. A list of BOM-related reports appears. Common report names include:
   - **BOM Costing Report**
   - **BOM Material Requirement Report**
   - **BOM Version History Report**
   - **BOM Usage Report**

### 2.0 Run the BOM Costing Report

1. Click **BOM Costing Report**.
2. In the filter panel, set:
   - **BOM**: select the BOM you want to analyze (e.g., “BOM-Danaval-Chocolate-001”).
   - **Company**: choose your legal entity (e.g., Charisma Global).
   - **Quantity**: enter the production batch size (e.g., 500 units).
   - **Currency** (optional): if multi-currency, select the currency for cost calculations.
3. Click **Refresh** (or **Run**).
4. The report displays:
   - **Raw Material Cost**: sum of (Required Qty × Latest Buying Rate) for each component.
   - **Operation Cost**: sum of (Operation Time × Operation Rate) for each step.
   - **Overhead/Additional Costs**: any fixed or percentage-based charges defined in the BOM.
   - **Total Batch Cost** and **Cost per Unit**.
5. Review each line item’s cost contribution.
6. To export, click `Download > CSV` or **Print** to share with finance or management.

### 3.0 Run the BOM Material Requirement Report

1. Click **BOM Material Requirement Report**.
2. Set filters:
   - **BOM**: select your target BOM.
   - **Quantity to Produce**: enter the planned production quantity (e.g., 1,000 units).
   - **From Warehouse** (optional): to check material availability in a specific location.
   - **Include Future Items** (toggle): if you want to consider materials on pending Purchase Orders.
3. Click **Refresh**.
4. The report lists all raw materials with columns:
   - **Item Code & Description**
   - **Required Qty** (scaled for your batch)
   - **Available Qty** (on-hand in the specified warehouse)
   - **Shortage Qty** (if any)
   - **UOM** and **Warehouse**
5. Use this report to create Material Requests or Purchase Orders by clicking **Create MR** from the toolbar.
6. Export with `Download > CSV` or print to share with procurement.

### 4.0 Run the BOM Version History Report

1. Click **BOM Version History Report**.
2. Filter by:
   - **BOM**: choose the base BOM number (e.g., “BOM-Danaval-Chocolate-001”).
   - **From Date / To Date**: specify a date range to see revisions submitted within that period.
3. Click **Refresh**.
4. The report displays:
   - **Revision No.** (e.g., “BOM-0001-01,” “BOM-0001-02”).
   - **Modified By** and **Modified On**.
   - **Change Log Summary** (fields changed, old vs. new values).
   - **Applicable From** date for each revision.
5. Click any **Revision No.** to open that historical BOM in read-only mode.
6. Export or print to archive revision data for audits.

### 5.0 Run the BOM Usage Report

1. Click **BOM Usage Report**.
2. Set filters:
   - **BOM**: select the BOM you want to investigate.
   - **Status** (optional): filter Work Orders by status (e.g., “Completed,” “In Progress”).
   - **Date Range**: define a period to see which Work Orders used this BOM.
3. Click **Refresh**.
4. The report shows:
   - **Work Order No.** and **Customer** (if linked to a Sales Order)
   - **Production Quantity** and **Completed Quantity**
   - **Workstation** or **Cost Center** (where manufactured)
   - **Status** of each Work Order
5. Use this to identify how many units have been produced from a given BOM, and which orders remain open.
6. Export with `Download > CSV` or **Print** for production dashboards and capacity planning.
