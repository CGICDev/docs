<Info>
  Prerequisites

  - At least one BOM exists under `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List.`
  - You have read-only permissions for Manufacturing if you only need to view (no editing privileges required).
</Info>

### 1.0 Navigate to the BOM List

1. From the left‐hand menu, click `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List. `
2. The **BOM List** shows all active and disabled BOMs with columns for **BOM No.**, **Item**, **Quantity**, **Status**, and **Applicable From**.

### 2.0 Locate the BOM You Want to View

1. Use the **Search Bar** at the top to type part of the BOM number or item name (e.g., “BOM-Bottled Water”).
2. Or click `Filters > Add Filter` to narrow by:
   - **Item** (finished product name)
   - **Status** (Active, Disabled)
   - **Applicable From** date range
3. Press **Enter** or click **Apply**—the list refreshes to show matching BOMs.

### 3.0 Open the BOM Profile

1. In the filtered list, click the **BOM No.** (e.g., **BOM-Bottled Water-001**).
2. The BOM form opens in **Read-Only** mode, displaying multiple tabs across the top:
   - **Production Item**
   - **Operations**
   - **Scrap & Process Loss**
   - **Costing**
   - **More Info**
   - **Connections**
   - **Website** (if configured)

### 4.0 Review Key Tabs

\*\*4.0.1. Production Item Tab  \*\*

- **Item**: Name of the finished good (e.g., Bottled Water).
- **Quantity to Manufacture**: Default batch size (e.g., 1000 bottles).
- **UOM**: Unit of measure (e.g., “Nos”).
- **Warehouse**: Source warehouse for raw materials.
- **Materials Table**: Shows each component:
  - **Item Code & Description** (e.g., “PET Bottle, Cap”)
  - **Required Qty** to produce the batch
  - **UOM** (e.g., “Nos”, “Kg”)
  - **Consumption Type** (Mandatory, By-Product, etc.)
  - **Warehouse** (where to pull that material from)

Use the scroll bar to see all rows. Hover over any component to view additional details (e.g., stock UOM, conversion factors).

\*\*4.0.2. Operations Tab \*\*

- **With Operations** checkbox: ensures operation costs are tracked.
- **Operations Table**: Lists each production step with columns:
  - **No.** (sequence)
  - **Operation Name** (e.g., “Filling & Sealing”, “Labelling”)
  - **Workstation Type** (machine or work center)
  - **Operation Time** (minutes per unit)
  - **Fixed Time** (tick if time does not scale with quantity)
  - **Operating Cost (NGN)** (calculated labor/machine cost)

Hover over each operation to view associated workstation details and cost breakdown.

\*\*4.0.3. Scrap & Process Loss Tab \*\*

- Displays expected **Scrap %** (e.g., 2% wastage) or **Process Loss** for the item.
- Helps plan extra raw material procurement to account for expected waste.

\*\*4.0.4. Costing Tab \*\*

- Provides a **Cost Breakdown**:
  - Total **Raw Material Cost** (sum of all components at current rates)
  - Total **Operation Cost** (sum of all operation times × workstation rates)
  - **Overhead/Fixed Cost** (if applicable)
  - **Total Cost per Batch** and **Cost per Unit** (automatically calculated)

Use the **Update Cost** button (if you have permission) to recalculate costs based on current purchase rates and operation rates.

\*\*4.0.5. More Info Tab  \*\*

- Shows custom fields such as **BOM Version**, **Notes**, or **Effective Date**.
- May include additional manufacturing attributes, e.g., **Batch Size Tolerance**, **Quality Standards**.

\*\*4.0.6. Connections Tab  \*\*

- Lists linked documents and transactions:
  - **Work Orders** created from this BOM (with status: Planned, In Progress, Completed)
  - **Material Requests** generated for raw materials
  - **Previous BOM Versions** (for easy navigation between revisions)

Click any linked document to open it directly.

\*\*4.0.7. Website Tab (Optional)  \*\*

- If you’ve configured e-commerce or product pages, this tab displays how the BOM links to your website catalog (less common in pure manufacturing setups).

### 5.0 View Version History

1. In any tab on the BOM form, click the **Menu icon (⋮)** or **“View History”** link (often located in the top‐right or at the bottom).
2. A pop-up displays:
   - **Revision Number** (e.g., 001, 002)
   - **Modified By** (user who made the change)
   - **Modified On** (timestamp)
   - **Change Log** (fields that changed, old vs. new values)
3. Click on a past version entry to open that historical BOM for review (in read-only mode).
