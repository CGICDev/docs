- **Create BOM**: Define a new BOM by listing all components, quantities, and production parameters for a finished product.
- **Edit BOM**: Update component lists, quantities, or operations on existing BOMs to reflect design changes or process improvements.
- **Delete BOM**: Remove obsolete or test BOMs from the system to keep your master data clean.
- **View BOM**: Inspect a BOM’s details—components, assembly steps, and cost estimates—in a consolidated profile.
- **Search BOMs**: Quickly locate BOMs by code, product name, or description using global search and filters.
- **Assign BOM to Products**: Link a BOM to specific Finished Goods items so production orders automatically reference the correct recipe.
- **List Required Materials**: Generate a detailed breakdown of raw materials and quantities needed to produce one unit.
- **Set Assembly Operations**: Define each production step—machine, labor hours, and sequence—to guide shop-floor execution.
- **Define Product Structure**: Map parent-child relationships for multi-level BOMs, showing sub-assemblies and components hierarchy.
- **Manage BOM Revisions**: Track and maintain multiple BOM versions, with revision notes and effective dates for audit control.
- **Specify Alternate Materials**: List substitute components for each line item to handle shortages without stopping production.
- **Estimate Production Costs**: Automatically calculate labor, material, and overhead costs based on BOM details and rates.
- **Calculate Material Requirements**: For a given production run size, compute total material needs across all BOM levels.
- **Monitor Material Availability**: Check current stock levels vs. BOM requirements to highlight procurement or production delays.
- **Generate BOM Reports**: Produce comprehensive reports on cost roll-up, material requirements, and version history for planning or audit.
