title: "Specify Alternate/Substitute Materials"
description: "This shows how to define backup materials for CGIC products when primary ingredients are unavailable. Set up alternates once, and the system will automatically suggest them during shortages - keeping production running smoothly."
---

<Info>
  Prerequisites

  1. **Item Setup**: Both primary and alternate materials must exist as _Items_
     - Example: _Yeast-Brand-A_ and _Yeast-Brand-B_ for Valdana Bread
  2. **BOM Access**: Your user role needs permissions to edit Bill of Materials
  3. **Stock Settings**: Enable _Allow Item Alternatives_ in `Stock Settings`
</Info>

### **1. Overview**

**Alternate Materials** ensure CGIC maintains continuous production even during supply shortages. For example:

- Swap _Imported Yeast_ with _Local Yeast_ for Valdana Bread during shipping delays
- Use _Recycled Pulp_ instead of _Virgin Pulp_ for Onina Tissue to support sustainability initiatives\
  This feature prevents production halts without modifying your Bill of Materials (BOM).

### **2. Key Benefits**

- **Avoid Stoppages**: Automatically suggest backups when primary materials run low
- **Cost Control**: Use cheaper alternatives during price spikes (e.g., _Additive-Y_ vs _Additive-X_ for Luca Oil)
- **Flexibility**: Manage temporary substitutions without permanent BOM changes

### **3. Step-by-Step Setup**

#### **3.1 Define Alternate Items**

1. Go to: `Stock > Items > [Select Item]` (e.g., _Yeast for Valdana Bread_)
2. Under **Alternatives Section**:
   - **Add Row**
   - **Item Code**: Select substitute (e.g., _Yeast-Local_)
   - **Qty Ratio**: Set conversion (e.g., `1:1` if equal)

#### **3.2 Enable in BOM**

1. Open BOM: `Manufacturing > BOM > [BOM Name]`
2. Check **Allow Alternative Item** for relevant components
3. Set **Priority** (1 = highest preference):

   ```
   Primary: PET-Bottle-A (Priority 1)  
   Backup: PET-Bottle-B (Priority 2)  
   Emergency: Glass-Bottle (Priority 3) 
   ```

### **4. CGIC Product Examples**

| **Product**         | **Primary Material** | **Alternate**      | **Use Case**       |
| :------------------ | :------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| **Ovita Waters**    | Blue Caps            | White Caps         | Supplier shortage  |
| **Luca Engine Oil** | Additive-X (\$10/L)  | Additive-Y (\$8/L) | Cost reduction     |
| **Valdana Bread**   | Brand A Yeast        | Brand B Yeast      | Supply chain delay |

### **5. During Production**

- **Auto-Prompt**: System suggests alternates if primary stock is low during **Stock Entry**
- **Manual Override**: Operators can select alternates on **Job Cards**
- **Audit Trail**: Production records show which alternate was used
