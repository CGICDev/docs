description: "Ensure each manufactured item uses the correct Bill of Materials (BOM) by assigning (or linking) an active BOM to its corresponding finished‚Äêgoods item in the CGIC App."
---

<Info>
  Prerequisites

  - Finished-goods items and BOMs exist under:
    - `Stock > Item > Item List` (for product items)
    - `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List` (for BOM documents)
  - The BOM you intend to assign is in **Submitted** (Active) status.
</Info>

### 1.0 Verify the BOM and Finished-Goods Item

1. **Locate the BOM**
   - Go to `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List.`
   - Use filters (e.g., **Item = ‚ÄúDanaval Chocolate Bread‚Äù**) or the search bar to find the specific BOM you want to assign.
   - Confirm the BOM‚Äôs status is **Submitted** (Active) and its **Production Item** matches the intended product.
2. **Locate the Finished-Goods Item**
   - Navigate to `Stock > Item > Item List.`
   - Search for the product (e.g., ‚ÄúDanaval Chocolate Bread‚Äù).
   - Ensure this item‚Äôs **Is Stock Item** flag is checked (it must be a stock-tracked finished good).

### 2.0 Open the Finished-Goods Item Record

1. In the **Item List**, click the product‚Äôs **Item Code** to open its profile.
2. Review the **Item Details**: make sure the item type, UOM, and default warehouse are set correctly.
3. Click `Actions > Edit` to enable editing of item fields.

### 3.0 Link the BOM in the Item‚Äôs Manufacturing Settings

1. Scroll down (or click the **Manufacturing** tab, if shown) to find the **Default BOM** field.
2. Click the **Lookup (üîç)** icon next to **Default BOM**.
3. In the pop-up, start typing the BOM number or product name (e.g., ‚ÄúBOM-Danaval-Chocolate-001‚Äù).
4. Select the matching BOM from the list; the **BOM No.** populates automatically.
5. (Optional) If the item has multiple valid BOMs (e.g., seasonal recipes), confirm that the one you selected has the correct **Applicable From** date so it‚Äôs active for new production.

### 4.0 Save and Confirm

1. After selecting the **Default BOM**, click **Save** in the item form.
2. The item‚Äôs profile now shows the assigned BOM number under **Manufacturing Settings**.

### 5.0 Verify Automatic BOM Use in Work Orders

1. Create a new Work Order to confirm the BOM assignment:
   - Go to `Manufacturing > Work Order > New`.
   - In the **Work Order** header, select your product under **Production Item**.
2. When you select the item, CGIC automatically populates the **BOM** field with the BOM you assigned.
3. Confirm the **Quantity** and **UOM**; you‚Äôll see the component list and operations pulled from that BOM.
4. Click **Save** (and **Submit** when ready). The Work Order now references the correct BOM.
