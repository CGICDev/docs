<Info>
  Prerequisites

  - At least one BOM has been created under `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List `
  - You know at least one search criterion (e.g., BOM number, finished item name, status, “Applicable From” date)
</Info>

### 1.0 Open the BOM List

1. From the main menu, navigate to `Manufacturing > Bill of Materials > BOM List.`
2. The BOM List page displays all submitted and draft BOMs. Columns typically include:
   - **BOM No.** (e.g., “BOM-Bottled Water-001”)
   - **Item** (the finished product name)
   - **Quantity** (default manufacture quantity)
   - **Status** (e.g., Active, Draft, Disabled)
   - **Applicable From** (date when this version is effective)

### 1.1 Use the Search Bar for a Quick Match

1. Click the **Search** field at the top-right of the BOM List.
2. Type any part of a BOM number or item name (e.g., “Water-001” or “Chocolate Bread”).
3. Press **Enter**.
4. The list refreshes to show matches where the typed text appears in either the **BOM No.** or **Item** columns.

### 1.2 Apply Filters for Granular Results

1. Click `Filter > Add Filter` (usually to the left of column headers).
2. Choose a field to filter by from the drop-down. Common filters include:
   - **Item:** Search by the finished product.
   - **Status:** Select “Active” or “Disabled” to narrow by BOM status.
   - **Applicable From:** Enter a date range to find versions effective within specific dates.
   - **Quantity:** Filter BOMs that produce a certain batch size.
3. After selecting a filter field, choose the operator (e.g., **=**, **\>=**, **like**) and enter the matching value.
4. Click **Apply**. You can stack multiple filters to refine results further (e.g., `Item = “Davana Bread”`  AND  `Status = “Active”`).

### 1.3 Sort and Customize Columns

1. Hover over any column header (e.g., **BOM No.**, **Item**, **Applicable From**).
2. Click the small **arrow** icon that appears to sort ascending or descending.
3. To add or remove columns, click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the column headers and select **“Customize Columns”**.
4. Check or uncheck fields like **Quantity**, **Status**, or **Cost** to tailor the list view to your needs.
5. Click **Apply** to update the visible columns.

### 1.4 Save and Reuse Filters

1. After applying your desired filters and sorting, click **Save Filter** (usually at the bottom of the filter panel).
2. Give the filter set a descriptive name (e.g., “Q2 2025 Active BOMs”).
3. Click **Save**.
4. In future sessions, open **BOM List**, click **Filter ▶️ Saved**, and select your saved filter set to reapply instantly.

### 1.5 Open the BOM Profile

1. Once you locate the BOM row you need, click the **BOM No.** or **Item** link.
2. The full **BOM Profile** opens in view mode.
3. Review tabs such as **Production Item**, **Operations**, **Costing**, and **Connections** as needed.
4. If you have permission to amend, click **New Version** or **Edit** to make changes.
