<Info>
  **Prerequisites**

  - At least one warehouse is defined under `Stock > Warehouse `
  - You have a basic understanding of your warehouse’s physical layout (e.g., bins, racks, shelves)
</Info>

### 1.0 Enable Locations in Warehouse Settings

1. Navigate to `Stock > Warehouse > Warehouse List.`
2. Click the warehouse where you want to enable sub-locations.
3. In the warehouse form, check **“Enable Bin Location Management”** (or a similarly labeled option).
4. Click **Save**.

### 1.1 Create Bin/Location Records

1. Go to `Stock > Bin Location > New Bin Location.`
2. Fill in:
   - **Bin Code** (unique short identifier, e.g., “A1-01”)
   - **Warehouse** (select the parent warehouse)
   - **Parent Bin** (optional—if using a nested hierarchy like Rack → Shelf)
   - **Description** (e.g., “Front-Left Rack, Top Shelf”)
3. Click **Save**.
4. Repeat for each bin, rack, or sub-location in the warehouse.

### 1.2 Allocate Location During Purchase Receipt

1. When receiving goods, open a **Purchase Receipt** under `Buying > Purchase Order > Purchase Order List → Create > Purchase Receipt.`
2. In the **Items** table, confirm the **Qty Received** and **Target Warehouse** for each line.
3. A new **Bin Location** column appears (if enabled). Click in that cell to select the bin where you will store the received items.
4. If you need multiple bins for a single line (e.g., split across two bins), click the “\+” icon to add another row and allocate quantities to each bin.
5. After assigning locations, click **Save**, then **Submit**.
   - The stock ledger now reflects item movements into specific bin locations.

### 1.3 Allocate or Reassign Locations via Stock Entry

1. To move items into bins after initial receipt, go to `Stock > Stock Entry > New Stock Entry. `
2. Set **Purpose = Material Transfer**.
3. In the **Items** table, add the item, then:
   - **Source Warehouse/Bin**: select the current location (or warehouse if not yet stored in a bin)
   - **Target Warehouse/Bin**: choose the bin where you want to store it
   - **Qty**: enter the quantity to move
4. Repeat as needed for multiple bins or items.
5. Click **Save**, then **Submit**.

### 1.4 Verify Bin-Level Stock

1. Navigate to `Stock > Reports > Bin-Wise Stock. `
2. Filter by **Warehouse** and/or **Item**.
3. Click **Run**.
4. The report displays:
   - **Bin Code**, **Item Code**, **Qty on Hand** in each bin
5. Drill down into any bin to see recent transactions affecting that location.
