  Prerequisites

  - Sales Orders have been submitted under `Selling > Sales Order`

  - Carriers and shipping methods are defined (optional, via custom fields or integration)
</Info>

### 1.0 Generate a Delivery Note

1. Navigate to `Selling > Delivery Note > New Delivery Note.`
2. In the header, link to a **Sales Order** or **Pick List**:
   - Click \*\*Get Orders to \*\*`Deliver > Sales Order`, select your SO.
   - Or click \*\*Get Items to \*\*`Deliver > Pick List`, choose your Pick List.
3. The **Items** table auto-populates with item codes, quantities, UOM, and bin locations (if bin-managed).
4. Verify or adjust:
   - **Qty to Deliver** (matches PO or Pick List)
   - **Source Warehouse** and **Source Bin** (must reflect where stock is picked from)
   - **Target Customer Address** (pulls from Customer profile)

### 1.1 Add Shipping Details

1. In the **Shipping Details** section (below Items), enter:
   - **Carrier Name** (e.g., FedEx, DHL)
   - **Service / Shipping Method** (e.g., Ground, Express)
   - **Tracking Number** (to share with customer)
   - **Shipment Date** (defaults to today; adjust if delayed)
2. (Optional) Attach shipping labels, packing slips, or customs documents using the **Attachments** section.
3. Click **Save** to draft, then **Submit** to finalize.
   - Inventory is deducted immediately from the listed warehouse/bin.
   - A **Stock Ledger Entry** and **GL Posting** update stock value and COGS (if configured).

### 1.2 Print or Export Shipment Documents

1. With the Delivery Note open, click **Print** to generate a formatted PDF—this serves as the **Packing Slip** for warehouse staff.
2. Click `Download > CSV` to export item and bin data for scanning apps or 3PL integration.
3. Use **Email** to send the PDF and tracking number to the customer automatically (ensure Email Settings are configured).

### 1.3 Update Shipment Status

1. After the goods leave the dock, reopen the Delivery Note.
2. In the **Status** dropdown, select one of:
   - **“In Transit”** (goods have been picked up by the carrier)
   - **“Partial Delivered”** (if only some items shipped)
   - **“Delivered”** (confirmed receipt by customer)
3. Click **Save**.
   - This status update can trigger automated notifications or KPI updates on dashboards.

<Tip>
  If partial returns occur (e.g., damaged goods), create a **Sales Return** against this Delivery Note to adjust inventory and initiate crediting.
</Tip>

### 1.4 Monitor Outbound Shipments

1. Navigate to `Stock > Reports > Outbound Shipments` (or **Delivery Note List**).
2. Apply filters:
   - **Status** (e.g., In Transit, Delivered)
   - **Warehouse** (to see shipments from a specific dock)
   - **Date Range** (e.g., past 7 days)
3. Click **Refresh** for a consolidated view:
   - **DN Number**, **Customer**, **Shipment Date**, **Carrier**, **Status**
   - **Total Qty** and **Total Value** per DN
4. Drill down on any row to open the Delivery Note and see detailed item or bin-level data.
