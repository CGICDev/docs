<Card title="Overview">
  **What it does:**  

  - Allows you to scan item barcodes or RFID tags instead of manually typing item codes  

  - Accelerates key transactions: Purchase Receipts, Stock Entries (Transfers), Pick Lists, Delivery Notes  

  - Reduces data‐entry errors by verifying scanned items against system records  

  - Supports both 1D barcodes (UPC, EAN) and RFID tags (if hardware integration is set up)

### 1.0 Receiving Goods (Purchase Receipt)

1. **Open the Purchase Receipt form**  

   - Go to `Buying > Purchase Order > Purchase Order List`, select a PO, then click `Create > Purchase Receipt.`

2. **Activate Scanning in the Items table**  

   - Click into the **Item Code** cell of a new row.  

   - Use your scanner or RFID reader to scan the item’s barcode or RFID tag. The system auto-populates **Item Code** and **Description**.  

3. **Enter Quantity via Scan**  

   - After scanning the item, move to **Qty Received**.  

   - If your scanner is configured to send quantity (e.g., “ITEM123×5”), the system fills both item code and quantity. Otherwise, scan item once and manually type quantity.

4. **Assign Batches/Serials (if enabled)**  

   - For batch-tracked items, click **Add Batch**.  

   - Scan the **Batch Barcode** or enter Batch No. manually; system links the batch to the receipt line. 

   - For serialized items, click **Serial No.**, then scan each item’s RFID or barcode to assign unique serials.

5. **Save & Submit**  

   - Once all lines are scanned and quantities verified, click **Save**, then **Submit**.  

   - Inventory is updated instantly, with on-hand adjustments recorded in the Stock Ledger.

### 2.0 Inter-Warehouse Transfer (Stock Entry)

1. **Open a New Stock Entry**  

   - Go to `Stock > Stock Entry > New Stock Entry` and set **Purpose = Material Transfer**.

2. **Scan Source Item & Location**  

   - In **Items**, scan the item’s barcode or RFID tag to populate **Item Code**.  

   - In **Source Warehouse** (or **Source Bin** if bin-managed), scan the warehouse bin’s barcode label or enter it manually.

3. **Scan Target Location**  

   - In **Target Warehouse** / **Target Bin**, scan the destination location’s barcode.  

   - The system ensures the scanned bin belongs to the selected warehouse.

4. **Enter Quantity**  

   - Scan quantity barcode if supported, or type the number.  

   - Scan multiple times or use a handheld keypad to increment quantity by 1 per scan (if configured).

5. **Save & Submit**  

   - Click **Save** to review.  

   - Click **Submit** to deduct stock from source and add to target in real time.

### 3.0 Order Picking (Pick List)

1. **Open or Create a Pick List**  

   - Go to `Stock > Pick List > Pick List List`, click **New**, and select Sales Orders to pick.

2. **Scan Items for Picking**  

   - In **Items to Pick**, click the **Bin Location** cell and scan the bin’s barcode where the item is stored.  

   - In **Item Code**, scan the item barcode/RFID tag to confirm you’re picking the correct product.  

   - In **Qty to Pick**, type or scan quantity.

3. **Confirm Pick**  

   - Once the scanned item and location match, the row marks as picked.  

   - If bin or item mismatch, the system displays an error to prevent wrong picks.

4. **Save Pick List**  

   - After scanning all required lines, click **Save**.  

   - Click `Create > Delivery Note` (or **Stock Entry**) to move picked inventory out of the warehouse.

### 4.0 Shipping Goods (Delivery Note)

1. **Open Delivery Note**  

   - Go to `Selling > Delivery Note > New Delivery Note` (or use **Get Items from Pick List**).

2. **Scan for Verification**  

   - In **Items**, scan the item’s barcode/RFID to auto-populate **Item Code** and **Qty to Deliver**.  

   - Scan the bin label to validate warehouse location before shipping.

3. **Scan Package/Carton Labels**  

   - If you generate packing labels with barcodes (e.g., “DN-0001-BOX1”), scan the packing barcode to link the physical box to the Delivery Note.  

   - Repeat for each carton or pallet.

4. **Submit Delivery Note**  

   - After scanning and verifying each line, click **Save**.  

   - Click **Submit** to finalize shipment—inventory is deducted automatically, and shipping status updates.
