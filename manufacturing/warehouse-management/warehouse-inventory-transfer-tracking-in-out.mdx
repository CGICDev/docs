  **What it does:**  

  - Uses “Stock Entries” with purpose = Material Transfer to move quantities between source and target warehouses (and bins, if enabled)  

  - Updates on-hand quantities immediately for both sending and receiving locations  

  - Provides a searchable history of all transfer transactions for audit and reconciliation  
</Card>

<Info>
  Prerequisites

  - At least two warehouses are defined under `Stock > Warehouse`  

  - Bin/Location management is enabled if you need sub-warehouse tracking (optional)  

  - Items exist under `Stock > Item > Item List` and are set as “Stock” items  
</Info>

### 1.0 Create a Stock Entry for Transfer

1. Navigate to `Stock > Stock Entry > New Stock Entry.`  

2. In the header, set:  

   - **Purpose**: select **“Material Transfer”**  

   - **Posting Date**: date on which transfer occurs (defaults to today)  

   - **Company**: your entity (e.g., Charisma Industrial)  

3. Click **Save** to draft the Stock Entry.  

### 1.1 Specify Source & Target Warehouses (and Bins)

1. In the **Items** table, click **Add Row**.  

2. For each line, enter:  

   - **Item Code** (search or scan)  

   - **Qty** to transfer  

   - **Source Warehouse**: where the stock is coming from  

   - **Target Warehouse**: where the stock is going to  

   - **Source Bin** / **Target Bin** (if bin locations are enabled—click the magnifying glass to choose the bin)  

3. Repeat for multiple items or split quantities across bins within the same line by clicking the **“\+”** icon next to that row.

### 1.2 Review & Submit the Transfer

1. Double-check each row to confirm:  

   - **Qty** matches the intended transfer  

   - **Source** and **Target** fields are correct (avoid reversed warehouses)  

2. Click **Save** to validate calculations.  

3. Click **Submit** to finalize:  

   - Inventory in the **Source Warehouse/Bin** is reduced by the transferred quantity  

   - Inventory in the **Target Warehouse/Bin** is increased by the same quantity  

   - A **Stock Ledger Entry** is posted for each movement, creating a permanent audit trail  

### 1.3 Verify Transfer in Reports

1. To confirm the transfer, navigate to `Stock > Reports > Stock Ledger.`  

2. Set filters:  

   - **Item**: choose the transferred item  

   - **Warehouse**: leave blank (to see both sides) or filter individual warehouses  

   - **From Date/To Date**: covering the transfer date  

3. Click **Refresh**. You’ll see two entries: a negative “Qty Out” for the source and a positive “Qty In” for the target.  

4. For a consolidated view of bin-level balances, run `Stock > Reports > Bin-Wise Stock` and verify that the source bin’s balance decreased while the target bin’s balance increased by the same amount.

<Tip>
  Use `Filters > Warehouse` to quickly switch between source and target warehouse views.
