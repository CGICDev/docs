<Info>
  Prerequisites 

  - Sales Orders are submitted and pending fulfillment under `Selling > Sales Order`  

  - Warehouses are defined under `Stock > Warehouse ` 

  - Items exist under `Stock > Item`, with bin locations configured if using bin management  

  - Stock levels are up to date (submitted Purchase Receipts, Stock Entries, etc.)  
</Info>

### 1.0 Open the Pick List Form  

1. Navigate to `Stock > Pick List > Pick List List.`  

2. Click **New** to open a blank Pick List.

### 1.1 Select Sales Orders to Pick  

1. In the Pick List form, click **Get Orders to Pick**.  

2. In the pop-up, filter by:  

   - **Status = “To Deliver”** or **“To Pick”**  

   - **Warehouse** (choose the warehouse where items are stored)  

   - **Delivery Date** (optional)  

3. Select one or more Sales Orders that you want to combine into this pick list.  

4. Click **Add**—the selected orders appear in the **Orders** table.

### 1.2 Review and Consolidate Pick Items  

1. Scroll to the **Items to Pick** section, which automatically populates line items from the selected orders.  

2. For each row, verify:  

   - **Item Code** and **Description**  

   - **Qty to Pick** (sum of all linked order quantities)  

   - **UOM** (unit of measure)  

   - **Bin Location** (if bin management is enabled)  

3. If needed, adjust **Qty to Pick** manually (e.g., partial picking).  

4. Click **Save** to lock in the pick list—no further orders can be added without creating a new pick list.

<Note>
  If your warehouse uses bins, ensure each item row shows the correct **Default Bin Location**. Otherwise, warehouse staff can choose the bin at picking time.
</Note>

### 1.3 Print or Export the Picking List  

1. With the pick list open, click **Print** to generate a formatted PDF showing all items, quantities, and locations.  

2. Alternatively, click `Download > CSV` to send a digital copy to mobile scanners or third-party logistics systems.

### 1.4 Record Picking via Stock Entry or Delivery Note  

After warehouse staff pick and stage items:

A. Using Delivery Note  

1. From the Pick List form, click `Create > Delivery Note.`  

2. The Delivery Note opens with items and quantities pre-filled.  

3. Verify quantities and bin locations.  

4. Click **Save**, then **Submit**—this deducts stock and generates an outbound shipment.

B. Using Stock Entry (Material Issue)  

1. Click `Create > Stock Entry` from the Pick List.  

2. Set **Purpose = Material Issue**.  

3. In the **Items** table, confirm:  

   - **Item Code**  

   - **Qty to Issue** (matches Qty to Pick)  

   - **Source Warehouse** and **Source Bin** (if bin-managed)  

4. Click **Save**, then **Submit**—this moves stock out of inventory without creating an invoice.

<Note>
  Using Delivery Note is recommended if you invoice immediately; use Stock Entry for internal transfers or special workflows.
