</Card>

<Info>

  - Purchase Orders (POs) have been created and submitted for the incoming stock  
</Info>

### 1.0 Create and Submit a Purchase Order  

1. Navigate to `Buying > Purchase Order > New.`  

2. Populate header details:  

   - **Supplier**  

   - **Order Date** (defaults to today)  

   - **Required By** (expected delivery date)  

   - **Company**  

3. In the **Items** table, add each item code, quantity, UOM, and target warehouse.  

4. Click **Save**, then **Submit**.  

5. Note the **PO Number**—you’ll use it to track shipments.  

<Tip>
  Ensure each item’s **Target Warehouse** is where you plan to receive the goods, so inventory is updated correctly upon receipt.
</Tip>

### 1.1 Monitor Inbound Shipment Status  

1. Go to `Buying > Purchase Order > Purchase Order List.`  

2. Filter by **Status = “Submitted”** or **“To Receive and Bill”**.  

3. Click a PO Number to open the PO form.  

4. In the PO, locate the **Schedule** or **Delivery Timeline** section (if your setup includes shipment milestones).  

5. Update shipment progress as follows:  

   - **“Shipment Created”**: When supplier books the order for dispatch.  

   - **“In Transit”**: When goods are confirmed shipped (enter carrier and tracking details in **Comments** or **Additional Info**).  

   - **“Arrived at Port/Warehouse”**: When goods reach your receiving dock—update the **Expected Receipt Date** if it has changed.  

<Tip>
  Use the **Comments** section or a custom field (e.g., **Tracking No.**) to log carrier and tracking links for transparency.
</Tip>

### 1.2 Prepare for Receiving  

1. Under `Stock > Reports > Stock Balance`, run a quick report for the PO’s items to verify current on-hand vs. ordered.  

2. Check the **Warehouse Expected Arrivals** view (custom report or dashboard widget) to see all incoming POs with due dates.  

3. Notify your warehouse or store team of the expected delivery date so they can allocate space and manpower for unloading.

<Tip>
  Pin a dashboard widget—“Inbound Shipments This Week”—to your home screen for daily visibility.
</Tip>

### 1.3 Record Goods Receipt via Purchase Receipt  

Once goods physically arrive, follow these steps:

1. Open the original **Purchase Order** (`Buying > Purchase Order > PO List`).  

2. Click `Create > Purchase Receipt` in the PO toolbar.  

3. The **Purchase Receipt** form opens, pre-filled with PO header and item lines.  

4. In the **Items** table, verify or adjust:  

   - **Qty Received**: Actual quantity delivered (may be partial or over/under PO quantity)  

   - **Target Warehouse**: Should match where stock will be stored  

   - **Batch No. / Serial No.**: If your Item is batch- or serial-tracked, click **Add Batch** or scan serials to allocate received units.  

   - **UOM** and **Rate**: Verify costs; adjust if there are discrepancies in price or packaging.  

5. (Optional) Attach any **Inspection Certificates**, **Packing Lists**, or **Delivery Notes** under the **Attachments** section.  

6. Click **Save** to draft the receipt. Review the computed **Total Received Value**.  

7. When satisfied, click **Submit** to finalize:  

   - Stock levels in the specified warehouse are updated immediately  

   - A **Stock Ledger Entry** is recorded for each item (increase in-stock)  

   - An **Accounting Entry** moves value into inventory (debit) and records a provisional liability if not yet invoiced  

<Warning>
  Once submitted, the Purchase Receipt cannot be edited. Use **Cancel & Amend** if you discover errors (e.g., wrong quantity or warehouse).
</Warning>

### 1.4 Handle Partial or Over-Deliveries  

- **Partial Receipt**:  

  1. On the Purchase Receipt form, enter the actual received quantity (less than PO).  

  2. The remaining quantity stays open on the PO. The PO status changes to **“To Receive and Bill”** until fully received.  

  3. Create additional Purchase Receipts as subsequent shipments arrive.

- **Over-Delivery**:  

  1. If the supplier delivers more than ordered, change **Qty Received** to the higher count.  

  2. The system flags the PO as **“Excess Received”**.  

  3. Discuss with the supplier whether to accept overage (update PO accordingly) or return the surplus.  

  4. If returning, create a `Stock Entry > Material Issue` to send the excess back and adjust inventory.
