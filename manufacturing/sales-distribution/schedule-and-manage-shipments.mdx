<Info>
  **Prerequisites**

  Before scheduling a shipment, make sure:

  - A Sales Order has been submitted.
  - Items are available in stock or production is complete.
  - You have access to the Delivery Note and Shipment modules.
  - The customer’s shipping address and contact info are up-to-date.
</Info>

### Step 1: Create a Delivery Note

The Delivery Note is the document that records which items are being shipped, how many, and to whom.

**To create:**

- Go to Sales Order \> open the relevant order.
- Click Create \> Delivery Note.

Make any adjustments (e.g., partial quantity if doing a split shipment), then Submit the Delivery Note.

<Tip>
  If shipping directly from production, you can also create a Delivery Note from a Work Order or Finished Goods Stock Entry.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Schedule the Shipment

Once the Delivery Note is submitted, schedule the shipment:

- Navigate to Stock \> Shipment (or “Shipping Schedule” depending on your ERP view).
- Click New to create a new shipment schedule.
- Link the Delivery Note.
- Fill in:

  | Field                     | Description                                              |
  | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Delivery Date             | When the items are expected to ship                      |
  | Carrier                   | Name of logistics company (e.g., DHL, local transporter) |
  | Tracking Number           | Provided by the carrier (if available)                   |
  | Vehicle or Container Info | Optional but useful for internal tracking                |
  | Shipping Rule (Optional)  | Applies predefined shipping cost logic                   |
- Click Submit to finalize.

### Step 3: Hand Over to Logistics

Once the shipment is scheduled:

- Print the Delivery Note or Packing Slip.
- Physically hand over the goods and documents to your logistics provider or driver.
- Update the Tracking Number in the Shipment document if it wasn’t available earlier.

<Note>
  If the shipment is being handled by CGIC’s internal fleet, update vehicle info and driver details in the Shipment record.
</Note>

### Track and Manage Shipments

You can view all scheduled and delivered shipments in the Shipment List or through custom filters like:

| Filter              | What It Shows                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Status = Scheduled  | Ready to ship                              |
| Status = In Transit | Shipped but not yet delivered              |
| Status = Completed  | Successfully delivered                     |
| Carrier = [XYZ]     | Shipments via a specific logistics partner |

This gives your team visibility into what’s shipped, what’s pending, and what’s delayed—so you can respond quickly.

### Notify the Customer

Before or after shipment:

- Open the Delivery Note.
- Click Email.
- Attach the PDF and add a short message like:

  > “Your order has been shipped and is expected to arrive on [Date]. Please see attached for the delivery details.”

For even more automation, consider setting up email notifications when a Delivery Note or Shipment is submitted.
