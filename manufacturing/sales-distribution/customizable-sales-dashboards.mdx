### What You Can Track with Dashboards

Sales Dashboards can display:

- Total sales this month/quarter/year
- Sales by rep or team
- Top-selling products
- Sales by territory or customer group
- Pipeline status: open vs closed orders
- Outstanding invoices and collections

You can combine metrics and visuals (charts, graphs, tables) in one place for quick insights.

### Step-by-Step: Create a Sales Dashboard

**1. Go to Dashboard**

- From the sidebar, navigate to: `Dashboard > Dashboard List > New`

**2. Name Your Dashboard**

- Example: **Sales Manager View**, **My Sales KPIs**, or **Monthly Revenue Tracker**

**3. Add Dashboard Charts**

- Click “Add Chart”
- Choose from existing charts, or create a new one by:
  - Selecting the report (e.g., Sales Invoice Trends)
  - Setting the filters (e.g., last 30 days, specific rep or item group)
  - Choosing a chart type: Bar, Line, Pie, or Table
  - Naming the chart (e.g., “Sales by Territory - May”)

Repeat this to add multiple charts and KPIs to your dashboard.

### Tips for Building Great Dashboards

- Use filters to personalize each chart for specific reps, regions, or product lines.
- Drag and drop to reorder charts visually.
- Mix charts and tables for a balanced view of summary \+ details.
- Use naming conventions like “Q2 Revenue by Item Group” to stay organized.
- Don’t overload it\! Keep 4–6 focused charts per dashboard for clarity.

### View and Share Dashboards

- Access your dashboard under Dashboard \> Your Dashboard Name
- Share with others by granting dashboard permissions
- For team dashboards, you can:
  - Set them as default views
  - Add them to a user’s homepage
