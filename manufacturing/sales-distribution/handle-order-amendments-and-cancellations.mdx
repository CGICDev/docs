  Before you start, make sure:

  - You have the correct user permissions to view and edit Sales Orders.
  - You know the Sales Order number or have enough details to locate it.
  - The order is still active (i.e., not fully billed or delivered).
  - You've communicated with relevant teams (e.g., Production or Accounts) if the change may impact downstream processes.

### 1.0 Amending an Order

Let’s say a customer calls and wants to change something on their order—maybe the quantity, the delivery date, or even the item itself. No need to panic—here’s what to do.

**1. Locate the Sales Order**

- Go to the Sales Order section from the main menu.
- Find the order you need to amend. Use filters like customer name or order date to narrow things down.

**2. Check the Status**

- Before making changes, ensure the Sales Order status is Draft or Submitted.
- If the order has already been delivered or invoiced, amendments aren't allowed. You’ll need to handle those with a return or credit note instead (more on that in another guide).

**3. Amend the Order**

- If the order is Submitted, click Amend. CGIC’s system will generate a new version of the order, linked to the original and marked as "Amended."
- Make the necessary changes—adjust quantities, swap items, update expected delivery dates, etc.

Save and Submit the amended order. The original will automatically be marked as cancelled.

### 1.1 Cancelling an Order

Sometimes an order just needs to be called off—maybe due to stock issues, a customer backing out, or an internal change. Here's how to cancel it in CGIC’s system:

1. **Open the Sales Order**

- Head to the Sales Order list and open the one you want to cancel.

**2. Cancel the Order**

- If the order hasn’t been invoiced or fulfilled, click Cancel.
- Confirm when prompted. The status will update to Cancelled, and the system will handle stock and accounting rollbacks.

**3. Partial Cancellation?**

- If part of the order has already been processed, you won’t be able to cancel the entire thing.

In this case, use a Sales Return or issue a Credit Note for the fulfilled portion.

### 2.0 What Happens Behind the Scenes?

When you amend or cancel a Sales Order, CGIC’s App keeps everything tidy:

- Amendments generate a new linked document while marking the original as cancelled.
- Cancellations are tracked for audit purposes and reporting.
- Stock and accounting entries are updated automatically to reflect changes.
