- You’ll see linked prices. Click Create / Add Price.

**3. Enter Price Details**

- Set the Price List (e.g., Selling, Retail, Wholesale).
- Enter the Rate (price per unit).
- Choose the applicable currency and unit of measure (UOM).
- Save the price.

<Note>
  Multiple price lists can be maintained for different customer groups or regions.

### 3.0 Using Pricing Rules (Advanced)

Need to apply discounts for a specific customer group or create tiered pricing? That’s where Pricing Rules come in handy.

**1. Go to Pricing Rule**

- Navigate to `Selling > Pricing Rule.`

**2. Set Rule Criteria**

Choose whether the rule applies to:

- A specific Item or Item Group
- A Customer or Customer Group
- A specific Price List

**3. Define the Rule**

You can:

- Override price with a fixed value
- Apply a discount percentage
- Set min/max quantities for tiered pricing
- Set validity dates if it’s a temporary promo.

**4. Save and Submit**

- The system will now automatically apply this rule when conditions are met in Sales Orders or Quotations.

### 4.0 Best Practices

- Keep price lists organized by customer type (e.g., Retail, Distributor, Export).
- Periodically audit pricing rules to avoid expired or conflicting promotions.
- Coordinate with Sales and Procurement teams before making major changes.
