  **Prerequisites**

  Before issuing a Sales Invoice, make sure:

### 1.0 Ways to Generate a Sales Invoice

**1. From a Sales Order**

If no items have been delivered yet but you want to invoice upfront or partially:

- Go to `Sales Order > open the relevant order.`
- Click `Create > Sales Invoice.`
- The system will pull in all billable items and prices.
- Adjust quantities if issuing a partial invoice.

**2. From a Delivery Note**

This is the most common flowâ€”perfect for post-delivery billing.

- Go to Delivery Note \> open the document.
- `Click Create > Sales Invoice.`
- The invoice will include items delivered and pricing from the original Sales Order.

**3. Manual Entry**

Use this when you donâ€™t have a linked Sales Order or Delivery Note.

- Go to `Selling > Sales Invoice > New`.
- Select the**Customer**  and add **items,** **quantities,** and **rates** manually.
- Apply any **discounts, taxes**, or **pricing rules** as needed.

### 1.1 Collecting Payments

Once an invoice is submitted, you can:

- Record Payment: Click Payment \> Receive Payment if payment is received.
- Send by Email: Use the Email button to send the invoice PDF to the customer.
- Print PDF: Generate a print-friendly version for manual delivery or archiving.

### 1.2 Example: Create an Invoice from Delivery Note

1. Open the Delivery Note (e.g., DN-0001).
2. Click **Create \> Sales Invoice.**
3. System pre-fills:
   - Customer info
   - Items delivered
   - Taxes and pricing
4. Review, make edits if needed.
5. Click Submit to finalize.

  ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™re done\! The invoice is now part of the customerâ€™s account and ready for payment follow-up.
