### 1.0 Steps to Create a Sales Order

**Step 1: Open a New Sales Order Form**

1. Navigate to `Selling > Sales Order > New Sales Order.`
2. The blank Sales Order form will appear with header fields and an empty **Items** section.

**Step 2: Populate Header Fields**

- **Customer**
  - Click the lookup (üîç) and select the customer placing the order.
  - **Billing Address** and **Shipping Address** auto-populate; adjust if needed.
- **Order Date**
  - Defaults to today; change if recording a backdated order.
- **Delivery Date**
  - Enter the date by which the customer expects delivery.
  - SOs scheduled to deliver after this date will trigger a warning.
- **Price List**
  - Select the appropriate price list (e.g., ‚ÄúRetail NGN‚Äù or ‚ÄúWholesale USD‚Äù).
  - Item rates default from this price list but are editable per line.
- **Sales Person** (Optional)
  - Assign the salesperson or account manager responsible for this order.
- **Currency**
  - Auto-fills based on the price list; adjust if the customer pays in a different currency (subject to conversion rates).

**Step 3: Add Items to the Order**

1. Scroll to the **Items** table.
2. Click **Add Row** for each line item:
   - **Item Code**: select the stock item or service.
   - **Description**: auto-populates from the item master; you may add a custom note.
   - **Qty**: enter the quantity ordered.
   - **UOM**: defaults to the item‚Äôs default unit; adjust if needed (e.g., ‚ÄúBox‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúNos‚Äù).
   - **Warehouse**: choose the warehouse from which stock will be delivered (for stock items).
   - **Rate**: auto-fills from the selected price list; override if giving a discount or special price.
   - **Amount**: auto-calculated as (Qty √ó Rate) before taxes.
3. Repeat until all products/services are entered.
4. Use **Add Tax** (if required) to apply item-specific taxes or charges.
5. Review the **Grand Total** at the bottom to confirm the order value.

<Note>
  If the requested quantity exceeds on-hand stock, CGIC highlights the shortage and allows you to proceed with a backorder or partial reservation.
</Note>

**Step 4: Save and Submit the Sales Order**

1. Click **Save** to store the SO as a **Draft** (Status = Draft).
   - You can still edit header and item lines while in Draft status.
2. When ready, click **Submit** to finalize the SO.
   - Status changes to **Submitted**.
   - CGIC reserves available stock in the specified warehouse(s), creating a **Stock Reservation** entry.
   - The SO becomes available for creating Delivery Notes and Invoices.

### 2.0 Steps to Manage Existing Sales Orders

   - **Customer** name
   - **Status** (Draft, Submitted, Partially Delivered, Completed, Cancelled)
   - **Order Date / Delivery Date**
3. Click the SO‚Äôs **Sales Order No.** to open its details.

**Step 2: Edit or Amend a Draft/Submitted Sales Order**

- **Edit a Draft SO**
  1. Open the SO in **Draft** status.
  2. Click `Actions > Edit.`
  3. Modify header fields (Customer, Delivery Date), add/remove items, or adjust quantities/rates.
  4. Click **Save** to store changes, then **Submit** when ready.
- **Cancel & Amend a Submitted SO**

  2. Click `Actions > Cancel & Amend`.
     - CGIC creates a new draft version (e.g., ‚ÄúSO-0001-02‚Äù) preserving history.
     - The original SO is marked **Cancelled** and cannot be used for delivery or invoicing.
  3. In the draft copy, update any core fields or item lines.
  4. Click **Save**, then **Submit** to activate the amended SO.
     - Stock reservations from the original are released, and new reservations apply.

</Warning>

**Step 3: Create Delivery Notes from a Sales Order**

1. With a **Submitted** SO open, click `Create > Delivery Note` in the toolbar.
2. The **Delivery Note** form opens with:
   - **Sales Order** pre-filled.
   - **Items** table showing quantities still to deliver (Qty Ordered ‚àí Qty Delivered so far).
   - **Delivery Date** defaulting to today; adjust if shipping later.
3. Verify each line:
   - **Qty to Deliver** (adjust for partial shipments).
   - **Warehouse** and **Bin** (confirm correct pick location).
4. Click **Save**, then **Submit** to post the delivery:
   - Inventory is deducted from the specified warehouse.
   - The SO‚Äôs **Qty Delivered** updates, and its status changes to **Partially Delivered** or **Completed** (if all items are shipped).

<Tip>
  Print or email the Delivery Note to your warehouse team for picking and packing instructions.
</Tip>

**Step 4: Generate Sales Invoices**

1. After delivery, open the SO and click `Create > Sales Invoice`.
2. In the **Sales Invoice** form:
   - **Items** table reflects quantities delivered (Qty Delivered).
   - **Tax and Shipping Charges** carry over if defined on the SO.
   - **Invoice Date** defaults to today; change if billing later.
3. Click **Save**, then **Submit** to post the invoice:
   - Accounts receivable entries are generated.
   - The SO‚Äôs status updates to **Completed** if all items are invoiced, or remains **Partially Delivered** if balances exist.

<Note>
  If invoicing before delivery, use `Create > Sales Invoice` from the SO directly‚Äîbut adjust quantities accordingly and generate credit or debit notes if corrections are needed.
</Note>

**Step 5: Cancel a Sales Order**

- **Cancel a Draft SO**
  1. Open the SO (Status = Draft).
  2. Click `Actions > Cancel`.
     - The SO status changes to **Cancelled** and can no longer be submitted.
- **Cancel a Submitted SO**
  1. Open the SO (Status = Submitted).
  2. Ensure no linked Delivery Notes or Invoices exist.
     - If any exist, either cancel them first or adjust the SO so pending quantities are zero.
  3. Click `Actions > Cancel. `
     - All stock reservations from the SO are released.
     - The status changes to **Cancelled**.

<Warning>
  Cancelling an SO with pending deliveries or invoices can create inconsistencies. Always reverse or complete those documents before cancelling the SO.
