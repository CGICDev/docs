  **Prerequisites**

  Before you set up a pricing rule, make sure:

  - You have permission to access the Pricing Rule module.
  - You know which item(s), customer(s), or customer group the rule should apply to.
  - You have clarity on the type of pricing: discount, price override, or special rate.
  - The rule has been reviewed and approved by your Sales or Finance team if required.
</Info>

### Step 1: Creating a Pricing Rule

**1. Go to the Pricing Rule Module**

- Navigate to `Selling > Pricing Rule`.


- Click New to create a new rule.

**2. Give the Rule a Clear Title**

> Example: Retail Discount – 10% off for Product X

**3. Set Conditions**

Here’s where you define who and what the rule applies to:

| Field                      | Example                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Apply On                   | Item, Item Group, Brand          |
| Item Code                  | (if applicable) Product X        |
| Customer or Customer Group | e.g., Retail, Gold Members       |
| Price List                 | Typically “Selling”              |
| Valid From / Valid To      | Optional for limited-time offers |

**4. Define the Rule Logic**

You can choose one of the following:

| Option                | What It Does                                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Discount Percentage   | Reduces the price by a fixed %                  |
| Price Discount Amount | Reduces price by a fixed value (e.g., ₦500 off) |
| Rate (Override Price) | Replaces the default price with a new rate      |

Optional fields for **bulk or tiered** pricing:

- Minimum Quantity
- Maximum Quantity

<Tip>
  You can create multiple rules for different customer tiers, date ranges, or purchase volumes.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Managing Pricing Rules

Once you’ve created your rules, CGIC’s system helps you keep them organized and easy to maintain.

**To View or Edit Rules:**

- Go to `Selling > Pricing Rule List`
- Filter by:
  - Active/Expired
  - Customer Group
  - Item/Item Group
- Click any rule to edit or review

**To Deactivate a Rule:**

- Open the rule and uncheck "Enable"
- This prevents the rule from applying without deleting the record

<Tip>
  Clean up expired rules quarterly to avoid accidental application of outdated discounts.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Applying Pricing Rules Automatically

Once set up, pricing rules are applied automatically in:

- Sales Orders
- Quotations
- Sales Invoices

The system checks:

- Who the customer is
- What items they’re buying
- The quantity
- The date (if rule has validity period)

If everything matches, the pricing rule kicks in—no manual effort needed\!

<Warning>
   If multiple rules could apply, CGIC App  prioritizes based on specificity (e.g., item-level rule over group-level).
</Warning>

### 2.0 Reporting and Review
