### 1.0 Track Invoice Payments

When a payment is received, it should be recorded against the correct Sales Invoice.

**1. Record a Payment**

- Go to Selling \> Sales Invoice.
- Open the invoice.
- Click “Payment \> Receive”.
- Enter payment details:
  - Amount received
  - Payment mode (e.g., Bank Transfer, POS)
  - Posting date
  - Reference number (if available)
- Submit the payment entry.

<Note>
  🎉 The invoice status will update to Paid or Partially Paid, depending on the amount received.
</Note>

**2. View Payment History**

- Open any Sales Invoice.
- Scroll to the “Payments” section.
- You’ll see all payment entries linked to this invoice—along with dates and amounts.

### 2.0 Monitor Outstanding Invoices

Stay ahead of unpaid invoices using these tools:

**1. Sales Invoice List View**

- Navigate to **Selling \> Sales Invoice.**
- Use filters like:
  - Status = Unpaid / Overdue
  - Customer Name
  - Date Range
- Columns like Outstanding Amount and Due Date help you spot red flags quickly.

**2. Accounts Receivable Report**

- Go to **Accounts \> Accounts Receivable.**
- See:
  - Total outstanding by customer
  - Aging breakdown (e.g., 0–30, 31–60 days overdue)
  - Linked invoices
- Export to Excel or PDF for finance reviews or follow-ups.

### 3.0 Identify and Follow Up on Overdue Accounts

**1. Use Aging Buckets**

- In the Accounts Receivable report, look for invoices in the 30\+ or 60\+ day buckets.
- Prioritize follow-up based on oldest outstanding first.

**2. Send Payment Reminders**

- Open a Sales Invoice.
- Click “Email” to send a polite reminder.
- Use a template with subject lines like:
  - “Payment Reminder: Invoice INV-0001 Due”
  - “Your CGIC Invoice Is Overdue – Please Take Action”

### 4.0 Apply Payments Against Multiple Invoices

If a customer sends a lump sum for several invoices:

- Go to `Accounts > Payment Entry > New.`
- Select Payment Type: Receive.
