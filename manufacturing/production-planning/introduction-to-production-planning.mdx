- **Create Plan**: Define a new production plan with product SKUs, target quantities, and timelines.
- **Edit Plan**: Modify existing plans to accommodate changes in demand, capacity, or materials.
- **Delete Plan**: Remove obsolete or superseded production plans to maintain data hygiene.
- **Search Plans**: Quickly locate production plans by code, product, or date range using filters.
- **Track Progress**: Monitor real‐time status of each plan—planned, in progress, or completed.
- **Manage Schedules**: Allocate production slots on specific dates and assign resources or lines.
- **Track Output**: Record actual units produced versus targets for each run or batch.
- **Calculate Costs**: Automatically roll up material, labor, and overhead costs against each plan.
- **Integrate Materials**: Link production plans to Material Requests to ensure timely procurement.
- **Create Work Orders**: Generate work orders from plans to drive shop‐floor tasks and scheduling.
- **Link WO to BOM**: Associate each work order with the correct Bill of Materials for accurate routing.
- **Sub‐Assembly WO**: Manage work orders specifically for sub‐assemblies within multi‐level productions.
- **Custom Orders**: Handle one‐off or bespoke production runs outside standard planning.
- **Production Reports**: Produce reports on plan adherence, output, costs, and line performance.
- **Manage Lines**: Oversee multiple production lines, balancing load and shifting capacity as needed.
