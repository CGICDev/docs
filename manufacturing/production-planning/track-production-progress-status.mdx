<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="What it does" icon="sparkles" iconType="duotone">
    **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track progress of Work Orders for all CGIC product lines

    - **Operation-Level Updates**: Record completion at each production step (e.g., dough mixing â†’ baking â†’ packaging for Valdana Bread)
    - **Performance Analytics**: Compare planned vs. actual times and quantities
    - **Automated Alerts**: Notify supervisors about delays or quality failures
    - **Shop Floor Integration**: Update statuses via mobile devices or shop floor terminals
  </Card>
  <Card title="Why it matters" icon="sparkles" iconType="duotone">
    - Prevents missed deadlines for high-demand products (e.g., summer surge for Ovita Waters)
    - Reduces waste by catching errors early (e.g., incorrect viscosity in Luca Engine Oil blending)
    - Provides data to optimize workstation utilization (e.g., oven scheduling for Valdana Bread)
    - Ensures consistent quality across batches
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**

  - **Active Work Orders **Created from Production Plans (`Manufacturing > Work Order`)
  - BOMs with operations defined (e.g., "Bottle Filling" for Ovita Waters)
</Info>

### **1.0 Access Active Work Orders**

1. Go to: `Manufacturing > Work Order > List`
2. Apply filters:
   - **Status**: "In Process"
   - **Item**: "Valdana Bread"
   - **Workstation**: "Baking Line 3"
3. Key columns:
   - **WO No.** (e.g., `WO-033`)
   - **Planned Qty** vs. **Produced Qty**
   - **Delay %** (red highlight if \>10%)

### **1.1 Update Progress via Job Cards (Shop Floor)**

_For per-operation tracking (e.g., Ovita Waters filling):_

1. **Open Job Card**:
   - Scan Work Order QR code at workstation
   - _Or_ go to `Manufacturing > Job Card > List`
2. **Record Progress**:
   - Select operation (e.g., "Bottle Filling")
   - Enter **Completed Qty** (e.g., 4,500/10,000)
   - Log downtime/issues in **Remarks**
3. **Quality Check**:
   - Record defects (e.g., "2% underfilled bottles")
   - Attach photos if enabled
4. **Submit**:
   - Status auto-updates to "Completed" when qty reached

### **1.2 Monitor Real-Time Dashboards**

1. **Production Dashboard** (`Manufacturing > Dashboard`):
   - **Work Order Status Tiles**:
     - Not Started (Blue) Â· In Process (Yellow) Â· Completed (Green) Â· Stopped (Red)
   - **Bottleneck Analysis**:
     - Longest-running operations (e.g., "Valdana Bread Baking: Avg. 45 mins vs. Planned 40 mins")
   - **Quality Heatmap**:
     - Defect rates by workstation (e.g., "Packaging Line 1: 3% damaged tissue packs")
2. **Gantt View**:
   - Drag/drop Work Orders to reschedule
   - Visualize overlaps (e.g., Luca Oil blending vs. Ovita filling)

### **1.3 Handle Exceptions**

1. **Pause Production**:
   - In Job Card â†’ Click **Hold** â†’ Select reason (e.g., "Machine Breakdown")
2. **Reroute Work**:
   - Reassign Work Order to alternate workstation (e.g., move Valdana Bread to Oven 2)
3. **Short-Closing**:
   - Mark Work Order as "Completed" early if partially finished (e.g., 8,000/10,000 Ovita Waters)

| **Operations**                                                    | **Workstation** | **Status**    | **Completed** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Pulp Mixing                                                       | Mixer 5         | âœ… Completed   | 10,000 kg     |

| Packaging                                                         | Pack Station 1  | âšª Not Started | 0             |
| **Delay**: Embossing running 20% slow â†’ Alert sent to maintenance |                 |               |               |

### **3.0 Troubleshooting**

| **Issue**                   | **Solution**                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Job Card not opening        | Check Work Order status = "In Process"                    |
| Completed Qty not updating  | Verify "Allow Partial Completion" enabled in Work Order   |
| Delay alerts not triggering | Configure thresholds in `Manufacturing Settings > Alerts` |
