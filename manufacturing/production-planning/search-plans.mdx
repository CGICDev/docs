  - You know at least one search criterion (e.g., plan number, production item, status, date).
</Info>

### 1.0 Open the Production Plan List

1. From the main menu, navigate to `Manufacturing > Production Plan > Production Plan List.`
2. The list view displays all submitted and draft Production Plans with columns such as:
   - **Plan No.**
   - **Production Item**
   - **Planned Qty**
   - **Start Date** / **End Date**
   - **Status** (Draft, Submitted, On Hold, Cancelled)

### 1.1 Use the Global Search Bar

1. Click the **Search** field at the top-right of the Production Plan List.
2. Type any part of the **Plan No.** (e.g., “PP-2025-001”) or **Production Item** name (e.g., “Danaval Bread”).
3. Press **Enter**.
4. The list refreshes to show only matching records where your search text appears in **Plan No.** or **Production Item**.

### 1.2 Apply Filters for Granular Results

1. Click `Filter > Add Filter` (usually located above the column headers).
2. Select a filter field from the dropdown. Common filters include:
   - **Plan No.** (exact or partial match)
   - **Production Item** (e.g., “Ovita Water Bottling”)
   - **Status** (Draft, Submitted, On Hold, Cancelled)
   - **Start Date** / **End Date** (e.g., plans starting in Q2 2025)
   - **Priority** (High, Medium, Low)
3. Choose the operator (e.g., `=`, `>=`, `<=`, `like`) and enter the value.
4. Click **Apply**. You can add multiple filters to narrow results further (e.g., `Production Item = “Danaval Bread”` AND `Status = “Submitted”`).

<Tip>
  To find plans that start after a certain date, set:

  \> - Field: **Start Date**

  \> - Operator: **\>**

  \> - Value: **2025-04-01**
</Tip>

### 1.3 Sort and Customize Columns

1. To sort, hover over a column header (e.g., **Start Date** or **Plan No.**) and click the up/down arrow that appears.
2. To add or remove columns, click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the column headers and choose **Customize Columns**.
3. Check or uncheck fields like **Priority**, **Planned Qty**, or **Comments** to tailor the view.
4. Click **Apply** to update the display.

### 1.4 Save and Reuse Filtered Views

1. After applying your desired filters and sorting, click **Save Filter** (usually at the bottom of the filter panel).
2. Give the filter set a descriptive name (e.g., “Q2 2025 High Priority”).
3. Click **Save**.
4. In future sessions, open **Production Plan List**, click `Filter > Saved`, and select your saved filter to reapply quickly.
