title: "Track Production Output (Units Produced)"
description: "Accurately track and validate the quantity of units manufactured during production runs, enabling real-time inventory updates, performance analysis, and quality control in the CGIC App."
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**

  - **Active Work Orders** Must exist in **"In Process"** or **"Completed"** status (e.g., `WO-101` for 10,000 Ovita Waters bottles)
  - Finished Goods warehouses configured (e.g., _Tissue Finished Stock_, _Beverage Warehouse_)
</Info>

### **1.0 Enter Output via Job Cards (Per-Operation)**

_For granular tracking during production:_

1. At each workstation, open **Job Card** for the operation:
   - Scan Work Order QR code _or_ go to **Manufacturing \> Job Card \> List**
2. Enter **Completed Quantity**:
   - Example: _"Bottling Line 1: 4,500/10,000 Ovita Waters filled"_
3. Record **Scrap/Defective Units**:
   - Specify reason (e.g., _"Underfilled: 50 bottles"_ for Ovita Waters)
4. Submit → System updates Work Order progress automatically

### **1.1 Validate Final Output at Work Order Completion**

_When all operations finish:_

1. Go to: **Manufacturing \> Work Order \> [WO Number]**
2. Review **Produced Quantity**:
   - Auto-calculated from Job Cards (e.g., _9,850/10,000 Onina Tissue packs_)
3. **Handle Variances**:

   | **Scenario**          | **Action**                                                                         |
   | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Output \< Planned** | Click **Short Close** → Enter reason (e.g., _"Yeast shortage - 200 loaves short"_) |
   | **Output \> Planned** | Manually increase quantity → Add justification (e.g., _"Extra dough batch used"_)  |
4. **Complete Work Order**:
   - System:
     - Adds finished goods to warehouse (e.g., _9,850 Onina Tissue packs to Finished Goods_)
     - Deducts raw material consumption
     - Triggers quality inspection if configured

### **1.2 Monitor Output Reports**

#### **A. Real-Time Dashboards**

1. **Production Output Dashboard** (**Manufacturing \> Dashboard**):
   - **Today's Output by Product**:

     ```
     • Valdana Bread: 8,200/10,000 loaves  
     • Luca Engine Oil: 1,500 liters (100% of target)  
     ```
   - **Line Efficiency**:\
     \*"Ovita Filling Line 1: 95.2% (4,760 bottles/hr vs. 5,000 target)"\*

#### **B. Scheduled Reports**

1. **Daily Production Report** (**Manufacturing \> Reports \> Production Analytics**):
   - Filter by product/workstation
   - Export to PDF for shift handovers

## **2.0 CGIC Product Examples**

### **2.0.1 Onina Tissue Production**

| **Work Order**                                                     | **Operation** | **Completed** | **Scrap**          |
