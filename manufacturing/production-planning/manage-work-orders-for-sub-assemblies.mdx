<Info>
  **Prerequisites**

  - Items created with \*\*Item Type = "Sub Assembly" \*\*on `Stock > Items > New Item`
  - BOM defining subassembly components/operations (e.g., _Dough Batch BOM = flour \+ water \+ yeast_). `Manufacturing > BOM > New`
  - Dedicated stations for subassembly production (e.g., _Mixing Station 1_ for Valdana Bread dough)
</Info>

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Create Work Order for Subassembly**

1. Go to: `Manufacturing > Work Order > New`
2. Configure:
   - **Item**: Select subassembly (e.g., _"Pre-Mixed Oil"_)
   - **Quantity**: Needed for parent production (e.g., _1,000L for Luca Oil batch_)
   - **Planned Start Date**: Earlier than parent Work Order
   - **Warehouse**:
     - Source: _Raw Material Warehouse_ (for components)
     - Target: _Subassembly Stock_ (for finished subassembly)
3. **Link to Parent** (Optional):
   - Add **Parent Work Order** field if creating manually
4. **Submit** → Triggers Job Cards for operations

### **Step 2: Auto-Generate via Parent Work Order**

_For automatic nesting (recommended):_

1. In **Parent Work Order** (e.g., _"Luca Engine Oil 5W-30"_):
   - Enable **Produce Subassemblies**
2. System auto-creates:
   - Subassembly Work Order for _"Pre-Mixed Oil"_
   - Dependency: Subassembly WO must complete before parent starts
3. View nested WOs:
   - **Subassemblies Table**: Status, Quantity, Completion Date

### **Step 3: Track Subassembly Production**

1. **Job Cards**:
   - Update progress per operation (e.g., _"Base Oil Mixing: 500L/1,000L"_)
2. **Quality Checks**:
   - Record defects (e.g., _"Viscosity out of spec - 10L rejected"_)
3. **Complete Subassembly WO**:
   - Output moves to _Subassembly Stock_
   - Parent Work Order auto-unlocks when ready

### **Step 4: Consume in Final Assembly**

1. **Auto-Consumption**:
   - When parent Work Order starts, system pulls subassembly from _Subassembly Stock_
2. **Manual Transfer**:
   - Create **Stock Entry** if not auto-consumed:
     - Purpose: _Material Transfer_
     - From: _Subassembly Stock_
     - To: _Work-in-Progress Warehouse_
