<Card title="What it does" icon="sparkles" iconType="duotone">
  - Creates a Work Order (WO) that ties a finished‐goods item to its BOM, required quantity, and production schedule
  - Allocates raw materials and operations to that WO, reserving components and logging actual consumption
  - Tracks WO status (Draft, Submitted, In Process, Completed, Cancelled) through each stage of production
  - Updates inventory (stock ledger) and costing as materials are issued and finished goods are received
</Card>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 1.0 Open the New Work Order Form

1. Navigate to `Manufacturing > Work Order > New Work Order.`  

2. A blank Work Order form opens with fields for header information and an empty **Items** section.

### 1.1 Populate Header Details

- **Work Order No.**  

  - Auto-generated (e.g., “WO-2025-0001”). You may override if you have a custom naming series.

- **Production Item**  

  - Click the lookup (🔍) and select the finished‐goods item (e.g., “Danaval Bread—Chocolate Loaf”).  

  - Once selected, **UOM** auto-fills based on the item’s default.

- **BOM**  

  - Click the lookup to select the appropriate BOM. Only active BOM versions whose **Applicable From** date ≤ today appear.  

  - If multiple BOMs exist, choose the one matching your production specifications.

- **Quantity**  

  - Enter the number of units you intend to produce (e.g., “500”).  

  - The BOM’s component quantities will scale automatically in the **Material Request** and **Items** tables.

- **UOM**  

  - Auto-populates based on the finished‐goods item’s unit of measure (e.g., “Nos” or “Kg”).

- **Company**  

  - Select your legal entity (e.g., “Charisma Global Industrial Co.”).

- **Planned Start Date** / **Planned End Date**  

  - Enter the dates your production run should begin and finish.  

  - If left blank, you can schedule later via **Production Schedule** or in the WO’s **Operations** section (if operation times are defined).

- **Workstation** (Optional)  

  - If your company tracks capacity by workstation, select the primary workstation (e.g., “Baking Oven #2”).  

  - If you have multiple operations on different workstations, define them later in the **Operations** table.

- **Project / Cost Center** (Optional)  

  - Assign a project or cost center to track production overhead and costs in financial reports.

- **Remarks** (Optional)  

  - Add any notes about this Work Order (e.g., “Urgent customer order—rush production”).

### 1.2 Save as Draft

1. Click **Save** to save the WO as a draft.  

   - The system validates required fields: **Production Item**, **BOM**, **Quantity**, and **Company**.  

   - A draft WO will have **Status = Draft**. You can still modify header fields.

### 1.3 Generate Material Request (Optional but Recommended)

1. With the draft Work Order open, click `Actions > Make Material Request.`  

2. A **Material Request** form opens with:  

   - **Request Type = “Manufacture”**  

   - **Work Order** field pre-filled with the current WO No.  

   - **BOM** and **Quantity** also pre-filled.  

3. Click **Get Items from BOM** (or **Fetch Items**) to explode the BOM and list all required raw materials (scaled to the WO quantity).  

4. Review each row:  

   - **Item Code**, **Required Qty**, **UOM**, **Warehouse**.  

   - Adjust **Warehouse** if materials must be sourced from a different location.  

5. Click **Save**, then **Submit** to reserve raw materials in the specified warehouse(s).  

6. Return to the Work Order (click **Back**)—you’ll see a link under **Material Request** indicating the MR was created.

### 1.4 Add Operations (If Tracking Workstation/Time)

1. Click the **Operations** tab within the Work Order form.  

2. If the **With Operations** checkbox is not already ticked, click it to enable the operations section.  

3. Click **Add Row** for each production step:  

   - **Operation**: Select from existing operation types (e.g., “Mixing,” “Baking,” “Packaging”).  

   - **Workstation**: Choose the machine or work center where this step occurs.  

   - **Planned Time (Minutes)**: Enter the expected time per unit or batch (e.g., “0.500” minutes per loaf).  

   - **Fixed Time (Minutes)**: If the step takes a flat time regardless of quantity (e.g., “5” minutes for oven preheat), enter that here.  

   - **Sequence**: Number the steps in production order (1, 2, 3, …).  

4. Repeat for all operations in your production process.  

5. Click **Save**.  

   - CGIC now has a planned operation schedule that can inform capacity planning.

### 1.5 Submit the Work Order

1. After materials and operations (optional) are set up, click **Submit** at the top-right.  

   - The WO status changes to **“Submitted”**.  

   - CGIC reserves raw materials (if MR was submitted) and flags the WO as **“To Start”** in production dashboards.  

   - A **Stock Ledger Entry** is not yet created for finished goods until you record actual production.

2. If you need to schedule the WO, use **Actions ▶️ Schedule** or add it to a **Production Schedule**—ensuring shop‐floor teams know when to begin.

### 2.0  Steps to Manage Existing Work Orders

### 2.0.1 Locate the Work Order

1. Go to `Manufacturing > Work Order > Work Order List.`  

2. Use the **Global Search** or `Filter > Add Filter` to find your WO by:  

   - **Work Order No.**  

   - **Production Item**  

   - **Status** (Draft, Submitted, In Process, Completed, Cancelled)  

   - **Planned Start Date** / **End Date**  

3. Click the WO’s **Work Order No.** to open its profile.

### 2.0.2 Edit or Amend a Work Order

<Warning>
  You can only edit a WO if its status is **“Draft”, “Submitted”, or “In Process”** and no finished goods have been submitted. If the WO is **“Completed”**, you must create a new WO or use an adjustment method.
</Warning>

1. With the WO open, click `Actions > Edit` (if status is Draft or Submitted).  

2. Modify fields as needed:  

   - **Planned End Date** or **Start Date** (to shift the production timeline).  

   - **Quantity** (if customer order changes, but only if no finished goods have been received).  

   - **Workstation** or **Operations** (e.g., move a step to a different machine).  

3. To change the core BOM or item after submission, click `Actions > Cancel`:  

   - CGIC creates a new draft version of the WO (e.g., “WO-2025-0001-02”) preserving history.  

   - In the new draft, update **Production Item**, **BOM**, **Quantity**, and **Materials/Operations** as needed.  

   - Click **Save**, then **Submit** to reactivate the updated WO.  

### 2.0.3: Start Production (Material Issue & Operation Log)

1. When production physically begins, open the submitted WO and click `Actions > Start` (if enabled).  

   - Status changes to **“In Process”**.  

   - If you track time, operators can now log **Actual Start Time** for operations.

2. **Issue Materials**:  

   - Click `Create > Stock Entry` (Purpose = “Manufacture”) from the WO toolbar.  

   - The **Stock Entry** form opens with:  

     - **Work Order** pre-filled.  

     - **Items** table populated with BOM components and **Required Qty**.  

   - Enter **Qty to Consume** (actual quantity consumed, which may exceed or be less than required). 

   - Assign **Source Warehouse / Bin** and **Batch No.** (if applicable).  

   - Click **Save**, then **Submit**—deducting actual material consumption from inventory and posting a stock ledger entry.

3. **Log Operations (If Tracked)**:  

   - In the WO’s **Operations** tab, for each operation row, enter:  

     - **Actual Time Spent** (e.g., “0.600” minutes).  

     - **Operator** or **Employee ID** (optional, if tracking labor).  

   - Click **Save**.  

   - Repeat until all operations have actual time logged.

### 2.0.4 Manufacture and Receive Finished Goods

1. Once production is complete, click `Create > Stock Entry` (Purpose = “Manufacture”) or `Create > Delivery Note` (if shipping directly to customer).  

   - **Finished Goods Item** and **Qty to Produce** populate automatically.  

   - **Target Warehouse** for finished goods defaults to the item’s default warehouse; adjust if needed.

2. In the **Stock Entry** (Manufacture) form:  

   - Confirm **Qty to Produce** and **Rate** (value per unit, if needed).  

   - Attach any **Inspection Certificates** or **Quality Reports** in the **Attachments** section.  

   - Click **Save**, then **Submit**—this adds stock to your finished goods warehouse and posts the inventory value via a stock ledger entry.

3. The WO’s **Status** automatically updates to **“Completed”** once the Stock Entry is submitted.  

   - Actual vs. Estimated costs and material usage now appear in the **Production Costing Report**.

<Note>
  If a WO produces serial-or batch-tracked items, assign **Serial No.** or **Batch No.** on the Stock Entry before submission.
</Note>

### 2.0.5: Cancel or Close a Work Order

- **Cancel a Draft/Submitted Work Order**:  

  1. Open the WO in **Draft** or **Submitted** status.  

  2. Click `Actions > Cancel`.  

  3. Confirm the cancellation.  

     - CGIC reverses any reserved materials (if a MR or stock reservation existed).  

     - The WO status changes to **“Cancelled”**.  

  4. If you need to restart production later, click `Actions > Create New` to clone the WO and adjust details.

- **Close an In Process Work Order**:  

<Note>
  Use only if production cannot continue (e.g., machine breakdown). 
</Note>

  1. Open the WO in **In Process** status.  

  2. Click `Actions > Close.`  

  3. Enter a reason (e.g., “Machine failure—postpone remainder”) in the prompt.  

  4. CGIC marks the WO as **“Closed”**, preventing further material issues or receipt entries.  

     - Any unissued materials remain reserved until you create a new WO or cancel the closed one.

<Warning>
  Do not cancel a **Completed** WO. Instead, create a **Stock Reconciliation** for any adjustments or create a new WO for rework.
</Warning>
