<Card title="Overview" icon="sparkles">
  **What it does:**

  - Defines named groups for customers (e.g., “Retail,” “Wholesale,” “Distributors,” “Key Accounts”)
  - Enables assigning each customer to one or more groups
  - Simplifies filtering, reporting, and applying group-level defaults (pricing, payment terms)
</Card>

<Info>
  Prerequisites

  - At least one customer record exists under `Selling > Customer`
</Info>

### 1.0 Create a New Customer Group

1. Navigate to `Selling > Setup > Customer Group > New Customer Group `
2. Fill in the form fields:
   - **Group Name**: e.g., “Retail Customers”
   - **Parent Group** (optional): choose a higher‐level category if you’re building a hierarchy
   - **Description** (optional): notes on the group’s purpose or criteria
3. Click **Save**

<Tip>
  Use intuitive names (e.g., “Enterprise Clients,” “Online Shoppers”) so that reporting and filtering are self-explanatory.
</Tip>

### 1.1 Edit or Rename an Existing Group

1. Go to `Selling > Setup > Customer Group > Customer Group List `
2. Click the name of the group you want to modify
3. Click **Edit**, update fields (Name, Parent Group, Description), then **Save**

<Warning>
  Renaming a group does not affect historical reports, but it will immediately reflect in any active filters or dashboards.
</Warning>

### 1.2 Assign Customers to a Group

1. Navigate to `Selling > Customer > Customer List`
2. Click on a customer’s **Name** to open the record
3. In the **Customer Details** section, find **Customer Group**
4. Select one or more groups from the dropdown (use Ctrl/Cmd-click for multiple selections)
5. Click **Save**

<Tip>
  To assign multiple customers at once, use `Tools > Data Import` and update the “Customer Group” column in the CSV template.
</Tip>

### 1.3 Deactivate or Delete a Customer Group

1. Access `Selling > Setup > Customer Group > Customer Group List`
2. Click the group you wish to retire
3. To deactivate (soft delete), check **Disabled** and click **Save**—this preserves historical assignments but prevents new use
4. To permanently delete (hard delete), ensure no active customers remain in that group, then click `Actions > Delete` and confirm
