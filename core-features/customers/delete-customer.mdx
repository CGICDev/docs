description: "Remove outdated or erroneous customer profiles safely—either by disabling (soft delete) to preserve history or permanently deleting (hard delete) when no transactions exist."
---

<Info>
  Prerequisites

  - The customer exists under `Selling > Customer > Customer List ` 
</Info>

### 1.0 Option A: Disable (Soft Delete)

1. Navigate to `Selling > Customer > Customer List`  

2. Click the customer’s **Name** to open their profile  

3. Click `Actions > Disable` (or check **Disabled** if on the form)  

4. Click **Save**

<Note>
  **Result:** Customer remains in the database (for historical reports) but cannot be selected in new transactions.
</Note>

### 1.1 Option B: Delete Permanently (Hard Delete)

<Warning>
  You can only delete customers with **no** linked transactions (sales orders, invoices, payments).
</Warning>

1. Ensure the customer has **no** submitted Sales Orders, Invoices, or Payment Entries  

2. Open `Selling > Customer > Customer List ` 

3. Click the customer’s **Name**, then `Actions > Delete ` 

4. Confirm the deletion when prompted

> Use the disable function for most scenarios to preserve history, and reserve permanent deletion for truly obsolete records. This approach keeps your customer list accurate without losing crucial transaction data.
