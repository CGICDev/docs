### 1.0 Check Credit Balance in Customer Profile

1. Navigate to `Selling > Customer > Customer List.`
2. Click the customer’s **Name** to open their profile.
3. In the header section, locate **Outstanding Credit** (or **Credit Balance**)—this shows the total unapplied credit.

### 2.0 View Credit Details via Customer Ledger

1. Go to `Accounts > Reports > Customer Ledger.`
2. Set filters:
   - **Customer**: select your customer
   - **Account**: “Accounts Receivable – CGIC” (or relevant AR account)
   - **Date Range**: choose a period covering when the credit was issued
3. Click **Refresh**.
4. Identify entries with **Credit** amounts (e.g., Credit Notes, Overpayments).

  Negative invoice balances or unallocated payments appear as credits here.
</Info>

### 3.0 Create a Credit Note (If Not Already Issued)

1. Navigate to `Selling > Credit Note > New Credit Note.`
2. Fill in header details:
   - **Customer**
   - **Credit Note Date**
   - **Reference Invoice** (if crediting an existing invoice)
3. In the **Items** table, add lines specifying items, quantities, and rates to credit.
4. Verify **Total Credit Amount**.
5. Click **Save** and **Submit**—this automatically increases the customer’s credit balance.

### 4.0 Apply Credit to an Open Sales Invoice

1. Open a **Sales Invoice** for that customer under `Sales > Sales Invoice > Sales Invoice List`.
2. If the invoice is still unpaid or partially paid, click **Allocate Credit** (or **Get Advances**).
3. In the popup, you will see available credit amounts (from Credit Notes or advance payments).
4. Select the credit to apply—enter the portion or full amount to offset the invoice.
5. Click **Apply** and **Submit** the invoice; the credit automatically reduces the amount due.

<Note>
  If the credit exceeds the invoice, the remaining amount stays as credit balance.
</Note>

### 5.0 Issue a Refund (If Customer Requests)

1. Confirm that the customer’s credit balance is positive under **Outstanding Credit**.
2. Go to `Accounts > Payment Entry > New Payment Entry.`
3. Set:
   - **Payment Type**: _Pay_
   - **Party Type**: _Customer_
   - **Party**: select the customer
   - **Paid From**: your bank or cash account
   - **Payment Amount**: amount to refund
4. In the **References** table, choose **Reference Type = Credit Note** (or “Advance”) and select the credit entry.
5. Click **Save**, then **Submit**—this creates a negative receivable and reduces the credit balance.

<Info>
