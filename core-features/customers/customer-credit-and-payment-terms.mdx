### 1.0 Define Payment Terms Templates

1. Go to **S**`elling > Setup > Payment Terms > New.`  

2. Enter:  

   - **Template Name** (e.g., “Net 30”, “50/50 Split”).  

   - **Description** (optional).  

3. In the **Payment Schedule** table, click **Add Row** for each installment:  

   - **Due After (Days)** or **Due On (Date)**.  

   - **Percentage (%)** or **Fixed Amount**.  

4. Verify that total percentages sum to 100% (or fixed amounts equal invoice total).  

5. Click **Save**.

### 1.1 Assign Default Payment Terms to Customers

1. Navigate to `Selling > Customer > Customer List.`  

2. Click the customer’s **Name** to open their profile.  

3. Click `Actions > Edit`.  

4. In **Financial Settings**, set:  

   - **Payment Terms Template**: choose the default terms for this customer.  

   - **Credit Limit**: enter the maximum open balance you’ll extend (e.g., 50,000).  

   - **Default Receivable Account**: select your AR control account.  

5. Click **Save**.

### 1.2 Enforce Credit Checks on Sales Orders

1. When creating a new **Sales Order** under `Selling > Sales Order > New`, the system automatically checks:  

   - **Customer’s Open Balance** \+ **New Order Total** ≤ **Credit Limit**.  

2. If the new order exceeds the credit limit, a warning appears:  

   \> “Customer credit limit exceeded by [amount]. Please adjust order or request approval.”  

3. You can either:  

   - Reduce order quantities or apply a partial upfront payment (using **Advance Payment Entry**).  

   - Request a temporary credit limit increase (via your internal approval workflow).

\> ✅ **Tip:** Configure credit override workflows under **Selling ▶️ Setup ▶️ Credit Control** so managers can approve over-limit orders.

### 📅 Step 4: Monitor Outstanding Balances and Aging

1. Navigate to **Accounts ▶️ Reports ▶️ Accounts Receivable Aging**.  

2. Filter by **Customer**, **Company**, and **Date Range**.  

3. Click **Refresh** to view each customer’s:  

   - **Outstanding Amount** in current and aging buckets (0–30, 31–60, etc.).  

4. Drill down on any bucket to see specific invoices.

\> 🕒 **Tip:** Pin this report to your dashboard so you see overdue balances daily.

### ✏️ Step 5: Apply Credit Notes and Allocate Advances

1. To issue a credit (refund or discount), go to **Selling ▶️ Credit Note ▶️ New**.  

2. Link the original invoice, enter the **Credit Amount**, and click **Submit**—this reduces the customer’s balance.  

3. To record an advance payment, create a **Payment Entry** with **Payment Type = Receive** and apply the amount as an advance.  

4. When a new invoice is generated, click **Allocate Advances** on the invoice to automatically deduct the advance from the amount due.
