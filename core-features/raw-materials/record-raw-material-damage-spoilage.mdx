title: "Record Raw Material Damages/Spoilage"
description: "When raw materials are damaged or spoiled, you need to remove them from inventory to keep your stock levels accurate. In the CGIC App, this is done via a **Stock Entry** of type **Material Issue** directing the quantity to a “Damages” or “Scrap” warehouse."

<Info>
  Prerequisites

  - A “Damages” (or “Scrap”) warehouse exists under `Stock > Warehouse`
  - Raw materials are defined under `Stock > Item > Item List`
</Info>

> **Overview**
>
> Recording spoilage ensures your system reflects only usable raw materials. By issuing damaged stock into a dedicated “Damages” location, you maintain accurate inventory valuation and can later analyze waste patterns.

### Steps to Record Damages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a New Stock Entry" titleSize="p">
    1. Navigate to `Stock > Stock Entry`.  
    2. Click **New** to open a blank Stock Entry form. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose “Material Issue” as Purpose">
    1. In the **Stock Entry Type** (or **Purpose**) dropdown, select **Material Issue**.  
    2. This tells the system you’re removing stock.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Damaged Items">
    1. In the **Items** table, click **Add Row**.  
    2. For each damaged raw material:  

       - **Item Code**: select the material (e.g., “Premium Wheat Flour”).  

       - **Qty**: enter the spoiled quantity.  

       - **Source Warehouse**: choose where the material currently resides (e.g., “Raw Material Store”).  

       - **Target Warehouse**: select your “Damages” or “Scrap” warehouse.  

       - **Basic Rate**: auto-filled or adjust if needed for valuation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document the Damage ">
    1. In the **Remarks** field, briefly note the cause (e.g., “Heat damage,” “Contamination”).  

    2. (Optional) Attach a photo or inspection report via `Attachments > Add Attachment`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save & Submit">
    1. Click **Save** to draft your entry.
