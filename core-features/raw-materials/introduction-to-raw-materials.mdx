- **Add Material**\
  Create a new raw material record with details like code, description, unit of measure, and default storage location.
- **Edit Material Details**\
  Update attributes—specifications, packaging, safety data sheets, or reclassification—as supplier or process requirements change.
- **Delete Material**\
  Safely remove obsolete raw materials from your catalog when they’re no longer used, ensuring no active transactions reference them.
- **View Material**\
  Open a material’s profile to see stock summary, supplier links, purchase history, batch info, and usage statistics.
- **Search Materials**\
  Quickly locate materials by code, name, category, or custom fields using global search and advanced filters.
- **Categorize Materials**\
  Organize raw materials into logical groups (e.g., metals, plastics, chemicals) for streamlined reporting and procurement.
- **Track Stock Levels**\
  Monitor real‐time on‐hand, reserved, and available quantities across warehouses and stores to prevent stockouts.
- **Manage Suppliers**\
  Link materials to preferred suppliers, track lead times, MOQs, and negotiated pricing for each source.
- **Track Purchases**\
  View purchase orders and invoices per material, including received vs. ordered quantities and cost trends.
- **Set Reorder Points**\
  Define minimum and maximum stock levels; automatically trigger purchase requisitions when levels drop below thresholds.
- **Monitor Usage**\
  Analyze raw material consumption by production orders or BOMs to identify trends and support planning.
- **Record Batches**\
  Log batch or lot numbers on receipt for traceability, linking each batch to production and quality records.
- **Track Expiry Dates**\
  Manage perishable or shelf‐life‐controlled materials by recording expiry dates and flagging soon‐to‐expire batches.
- **Track Movements**\
  Log all inbound and outbound stock transactions (receipts, issues, transfers) to maintain an audit trail.
- **Manage Returns**\
  Process material returns to suppliers for quality issues or over-deliveries, updating stock and supplier performance metrics.
- **Inventory Reports**\
  Generate real-time stock, consumption, and aging reports to support procurement and production decisions.
- **Cost Tracking**\
  Record material costs per purchase and calculate average or standard costs for production pricing.
- **Record Spoilage**\
  Capture scrapped or damaged quantities during handling or expiry, adjusting stock levels and cost of goods.
- **Financial Reporting Data**\
  Provide raw material valuations, purchase costs, and usage metrics for accurate financial statements and budget reviews.
