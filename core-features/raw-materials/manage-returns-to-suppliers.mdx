### **Method 1: Return via Stock Entry**

Use this method for direct returns without linking to the original Purchase Receipt.

1. **Create a Stock Entry**:
   - Navigate to `Stock > Stock Transactions > Stock Entry > New`.
   - Set **Purpose** to `Material Issue` or `Material Transfer`.
   - Under **Items**:
     - **Item**: Select the raw material to return.
     - **Quantity**: Enter the return quantity (negative value if allowed).
     - **Source Warehouse**: Select the warehouse where the material is stored.
     - **Target Warehouse**: _Optional_ – Use a virtual warehouse like `Supplier Returns` if configured.
     - **Batch/Serial No**: Assign if tracked.
   - Add comments (e.g., "Return to Supplier – Defective Batch").
   - **Submit** to deduct stock.

### **Method 2: Reverse Purchase Receipt**

Use this to link the return directly to the original receipt for better traceability.

1. **Create a Return Purchase Receipt**:
   - Navigate to `Stock > Stock Transactions > Purchase Receipt > New`.
   - Select the **Supplier** and raw material **Item**.
   - Enter a **negative quantity** (e.g., `-100`) to reverse the original transaction.
   - Under **Items**:
     - **Warehouse**: Select the source warehouse.
     - **Batch/Serial No**: Match the batch from the original receipt.
   - **Submit** to reverse stock levels and create a return record.
