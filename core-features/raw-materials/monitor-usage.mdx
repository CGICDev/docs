<Info>
  Prerequisites

  - Raw materials and finished goods are defined as **Items**
  - Bills of Materials (BOMs) exist for your production items
</Info>

### 1.0 Use Production Order Reports

1. **Open Production Order List**
   - Navigate to **Manufacturing ▶️ Production Order ▶️ Production Order List**.
2. **Filter by Status**
   - Use **Filters ▶️ Status = “Completed”** to see finished runs.
3. **Open a Production Order**
   - Click an order to view details. Under the **Materials** section, see exactly which raw materials and quantities were issued.

### 2.0 Review Material Consumption Report

1. **Access Material Consumption**
   - Go to **Manufacturing ▶️ Reports ▶️ Material Consumption**.
2. **Set Your Parameters**
   - **From Date / To Date**: define the period.
   - **Item Group**: select **Raw Materials**.
   - (Optional) **Production Item**: filter for specific finished goods.
3. **Run Report**
   - Click **Refresh**.
   - The report shows each raw material, quantity planned (per BOM) vs. quantity consumed (actual issues).

### 3.0 Compare Planned vs. Actual

- **Planned Qty**: the amount of raw material the BOM called for
- **Actual Qty**: the amount consumed via **Material Issue** entries
- **Variance**: planned minus actual—for spotting over-use or wastage

Use these insights to adjust BOMs, improve yield, or investigate production inefficiencies.

### 4.0 Drill Into Stock Ledger

1. **Open Stock Ledger**
   - **Stock ▶️ Stock Ledger**
2. **Filter for Specific Production Runs**
   - **Voucher Type = “Stock Entry”** and **Purpose = “Material Issue”**
   - **Against Voucher**: select your Production Order ID
3. **Analyze Movements**
   - Each line shows raw material out-flow with timestamps and batch/serial numbers (if used).

### 5.0 Adjustments & Returns

- If you return unused material from a production run:
  1. Create a **Stock Entry ▶️ Material Receipt**
  2. Link to the original Production Order under **Against Voucher**
  3. Enter returned quantities to update stock
