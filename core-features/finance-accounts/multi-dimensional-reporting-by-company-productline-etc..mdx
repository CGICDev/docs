### Steps to Generate Multi-Dimensional Reports

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Report Section">
    1. From the dashboard, go to `Accounts > Reports.`
    2. Choose a relevant report such as:
       - **Profit and Loss Statement**
       - **Balance Sheet**
       - **Trial Balance**
       - **Stock Ledger**
       - **General Ledger**
       - **Cash Flow Statement**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Dimensional Filters">
    Once inside the report:

    - **Select Company:** Choose which entity you want to analyze (if managing multiple companies).
    - **Product Line / Item Group (Optional):** Use filters like **Item Group** or **Product Category** in inventory-based reports.
    - **Cost Center:** Break down expenses and income by departments or units.
    - **Project:** If tracking financials by project, use the **Project** filter.
    - **Warehouse:** Useful for stock movement, valuation, or storage cost analysis.

    <Note>
      You can combine multiple filters for a more targeted view. E.g., Profit & Loss for _Product Line A_ in _Cost Center - Lagos_.
