When you receive and sell inventory, the **Valuation Rate** determines how much cost you recognize. In the CGIC App you can choose one of three methods under **Stock Settings** on each Item:

- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**
- **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)**
- **Moving Average**

Consider these transactions:

| Date       | Transaction | Qty | Unit Cost |
| :--------- | :---------- | :-- | :-------- |
| 2020-04-01 | Purchase    | 10  | 100       |
| 2020-04-06 | Purchase    | 10  | 120       |
| 2020-04-10 | Sale        | 15  | ?         |

### 1.0 FIFO

With FIFO, you consume oldest stock first:

- Take 10 @ 100 and 5 @ 120
- **Consumed Value** = (10×100) \+ (5×120) = 1,600
- Remaining 5 @ 120 → **Balance Value** = 600

### 1.1 LIFO

With LIFO, you consume newest stock first:

- Take 10 @ 120 and 5 @ 100
- **Consumed Value** = (10×120) \+ (5×100) = 1,700
- Remaining 5 @ 100 → **Balance Value** = 500

### 1.2 Moving Average

With Moving Average, you recalculate the average cost on each receipt:

- New average = ((10×100) \+ (10×120)) ÷ 20 = 110
- Sale of 15 × 110 = 1,650 → **Consumed Value** = 1,650
- Remaining 5 × 110 → **Balance Value** = 550

| Method             | Consumed Value | Balance Value | Total Value |
| :----------------- | :------------- | :------------ | :---------- |
| **FIFO**           | 1,600          | 600           | 2,200       |
| **LIFO**           | 1,700          | 500           | 2,200       |
| **Moving Average** | 1,650          | 550           | 2,200       |

Each method impacts your Cost of Goods Sold and inventory valuation differently—choose the one that best aligns with your financial strategy and inventory flow.
