### 2.1 Item Properties

- **Item Name:** Item name is the actual name of your product.
- **Item Code:** Item Code is a short-form to denote your Item. If you have very few Items, it is advisable to keep the Item Name and the Item Code same. This helps new users to recognize and update Item details in all transactions. In case you have a lot of Items with long names and the list runs in hundreds, it is advisable to code. To understand naming Item codes see [Item Codification](#). You can also generate Item Code based on a [Naming Series](#) by enabling this feature in [Stock Settings](#).
- **Item Group:** Item Group is used to categorize an Item under various criteria like products, raw materials, services, sub-assemblies, consumables or all Item groups. Create your default Item Group list under Setup \> Item Group and pre-select the option while filling your New Item details under [Item Group](#). Item groups can be sub-assemblies, raw materials, etc, or based on your business use case.
- **Default Unit of Measure:** This is the default measuring unit that you will use for your product. It could be Nos, Kgs, Meters, etc. You can store all the UOMs that your product will require under Set Up\> Master Data \> UOM. These can be preselected while filling New Item by using % sign to get a pop up of the UOM list. Visit the [UoM](#) page for more details

### **2.2 Options when creating an item**

- **Disabled**: If you disable an Item, it cannot be selected in any transaction.
- **Allow Alternative Item**: Sometimes when manufacturing a finished good, specific material may not be available. If you tick this, you can create and select an alternative item from the Item Alternative list. To know more, visit the [<u>Item Alternative</u>](#) page.
- **Maintain Stock:** If you are maintaining stock of this Item in your Inventory, ERPNext will make a stock ledger entry for each transaction of this item. Ensure to keep this option unchecked when creating a non-stock Item (make to order/engineer) or a service.
- **Include Item in Manufacturing**: This is for raw material Items that'll be used to create finished goods. If the Item is an additional service like 'washing' that'll be used in the BOM, keep this unchecked.
- **Valuation Rate**: There are two options to maintain valuation of stock. FIFO (first in - first out) and Moving Average. To understand this topic in detail please visit [<u>Item Valuation, FIFO and Moving Average</u>](#).
- **Standard Selling Rate**: When _creating_ an Item, entering a value for this field will automatically create an [<u>Item Price</u>](#) at the backend. Entering a value after the Item has been saved will not work. In this case, the Item Price is created from any transactions with the Item. The rate at which you'll sell the item. This will be fetched in Sales Orders and Sales Invoices.
- **Is Fixed Asset**: Tick this checkbox if this item is a company Asset. Check out the [<u>Asset Module</u>](#) to know more.
- **Auto Create Assets on Purchase**: If Item is a Company Asset, tick this checkbox if you want to auto create assets while purchasing this item through [<u>Purchase Cycle</u>](#). Check out the [<u>Asset Page</u>](#) to know more.
- **Allowance Percentage**: This option will be available only when you create and save the item. This is the percent by which you will be allowed to over-bill or over-deliver this Item. If not set, it will select from [<u>Stock Settings</u>](#).
- **Uploading an Image**: To upload an image for your icon that will appear in all transactions, save the partially filled form. Only after your file is saved the 'Change' button will appear on the Image icon. Click on Change, then click on Upload, and upload the image.
