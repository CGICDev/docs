### **1. Prerequisites**

Before creating a product you’re should have;

- Logged in and have access to CGIC App inventory management role.
- You know the **Item Code** or **Item Name** of the product to delete 

### **2. Steps to Delete an Item**

1. **Open the Item List**\
   - From the home page, navigate to Stock ▶️ Item ▶️ Item List.
2. **Select the Item**  

      - Find the product by typing its name or code in the search bar.  

      - Tick the checkbox next to the item you wish to delete (you can select multiple).
3. **Access the Actions Menu**  

      - Click **Actions ▶️ Delete** in the top-right corner of the list view.
4. **Confirm Deletion**  

      - In the confirmation dialog, click **Yes** to permanently remove the item.

   <Note>
     **Permanent**: Deleting an item cannot be undone. If you might need the item later, consider disabling it instead.
   </Note>
   <Note>
     **Dependencies**: ERPNext will block deletion if the item is used in open transactions (e.g., sales orders, purchase invoices). Close or cancel those first.

<Tip>
  To simply hide an item without deleting historical data, open the item record and check **Disabled**, then click **Save**.
