### 2. Deleting a Category

<Warning>
  Deleting a category will orphan or reassign its sub-groups and items. Proceed with caution.
</Warning>

1. **Select the Category**
   - In **Item Group List**, tick the checkbox next to the group.
2. **Actions ▶️ Delete**
   - Click **Actions ▶️ Delete** in the toolbar.

> **Best Practices**
>
> - **Hierarchical Structure**: Use parent/child groups to reflect your business (e.g., “Beverages ▶️ Bottled Water”).
> - **Consistent Naming**: Keep group names clear and concise for easy filtering.
> - **Archive vs. Delete**: Disable groups (uncheck **Is Group**) before deleting to preserve historical data.
> - **Review Regularly**: Periodically audit categories to remove or merge redundant groups.
>
> With well-managed categories, you’ll improve product discoverability, inventory reporting, and overall system organization in your CGIC App.
