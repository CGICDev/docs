### 1. Where Pricing Is Managed

Product pricing is managed via the **Price List** module. Each price list contains one or more price entries that map an item to a specific rate, unit of measure (UOM), and currency.

### 2. Steps to Manage and Update Product Pricing

1. **Access the Price List**

- Navigate to:  **Home \> Stock \> Item Pricing \> Price List**
- You can create a new price list (e.g., "Retail", "Wholesale", "USD Prices") or use an existing one.

2. **Add or Update a Product Price**

- Go to:  **Home \> Stock \> Item Pricing \> Item Price**
- Click on **New** to add a new price or search and click an existing one to update.

3. **Fields to Fill**

- **Item Code:** Select the product to assign the price.
- **Price List:** Choose which price list this price belongs to.
- **Rate:** Enter the price (e.g., 2,500.00).
- **Currency:** Select the applicable currency (e.g., NGN, USD).
- **UOM:** Select the unit of measure this price applies to (e.g., Each, Carton).
- **Valid From / Valid To:** (Optional) Set validity dates if the price is time-bound.

<Note>
  To update existing prices, you can search for the item and edit the rate field directly.

<Accordion title="Best Practices">
  - **Use separate price lists** for different customer groups (e.g., Retail vs Wholesale).
  - **Use “Valid From” and “Valid To”** to automate price changes based on dates.
  - **Audit prices periodically** using the **Item Price List Report** for inconsistencies.
  - **Avoid duplicate prices** for the same item, price list, and UOM — this can cause confusion during sales.
