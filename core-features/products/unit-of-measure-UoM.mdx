title: "Unit of Measure (UoM) "
description: "A Unit of Measure (UoM) defines how you quantify an Item in the CGIC App—whether in pieces, kilograms, liters, or any custom unit your business requires."
---

By default, the CGIC App comes pre-loaded with common UoMs (e.g., “Nos,” “Kg,” “Ltr”), but you can add more to suit your needs. When defining a UoM, you can select **“Whole Number Only”** to restrict entries to integers—ideal for indivisible items like crates or pallets. If you need to handle fractional quantities (e.g., 1.5 kg), simply leave that box unchecked.

Note that the UoM master list only stores the unit names; actual conversion logic is managed in **UoM Conversion Factor** records. Whenever you introduce a new UoM that must convert to existing ones, create a corresponding conversion factor—this ensures smooth calculations in transactions, reports, and BOMs.
