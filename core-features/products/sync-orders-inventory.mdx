### 1. How Integration Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sales Orders → Delivery Notes → Stock Out ">
    - When a **Sales Order** is submitted, it reserves stock but doesn’t yet adjust inventory.
      - Create and submit a **Delivery Note** against the Sales Order.
      - Submitting the Delivery Note generates a **Stock Entry** of type **Material Issue**, which deducts the delivered quantity from your warehouse.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Purchase Orders → Purchase Receipts → Stock In ">
    - When a **Purchase Order** is submitted, stock is not yet in hand.
    - Create and submit a **Purchase Receipt** against the Purchase Order.
    - Submitting the Purchase Receipt generates a **Stock Entry** of type **Material Receipt**, which increases your warehouse stock.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Returns & Exchanges ">
    - For sales returns, use **Delivery Note Return** to credit inventory back via a **Material Receipt** stock entry.
      - For purchase returns, use **Purchase Return** to debit inventory via a **Material Issue** stock entry.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Enable Stock Integration**
   - Go to **Stock ▶️ Settings**.
   - Ensure **“Maintain Stock”** is checked for all stock-tracked items.
2. **Configure Default Warehouses**
   - On each Item record, set **Default Warehouse** under the **Inventory** section.
   - Optionally, set a **Customer-specific** or **Supplier-specific** warehouse in **Stock Settings ▶️ Warehouse**.
3. **Use Order to Delivery/Purchase Workflow**
   - Always trigger inventory adjustments via Delivery Notes and Purchase Receipts—never by manual Stock Entry alone.
   - Link each Delivery Note to its Sales Order and each Purchase Receipt to its Purchase Order.
4. **Automate via Naming Series** (optional)
   - Standardize your document naming under **Setup ▶️ Naming Series** for Sales Order, Delivery Note, Purchase Order, and Purchase Receipt.

### 3. Monitoring & Reporting

- **Stock Balance Report:** Reflects real-time stock once Delivery Notes and Purchase Receipts are submitted.
- **Stock Ledger:** Shows every Material Issue/Receipt entry linked back to its originating document.
- **Reorder Report:** Uses updated stock levels to flag items below their reorder threshold.

<Accordion title="Best Practices">
  - **Reserve Before Issue:** Always create Sales Orders before Delivery Notes to reserve stock.
  - **Match Quantities:** Ensure Delivery Note quantities match Sales Order lines to avoid stock mismatches.
  - **Regular Audits:** Reconcile Physical Stock vs. Stock Balance using **Stock Reconciliation** entries.
  - **Permissions:** Restrict manual Stock Entry creation to senior inventory staff to prevent unsynced adjustments.
