**Warehouse**\
A Warehouse is a logical or physical location where stock is stored; every receipt, shipment, and transfer is recorded against a specific warehouse to give you real-time visibility into inventory levels and movements.

**Cost Center**\
A Cost Center lets you tag transactions to business units (departments, projects, or regions), aligning expenses and revenues with how your company actually operates—whether by product line, facility, or service offering.\

**User Role**\
A User Role bundles permissions that control what features and data a user can access—such as System Manager, Accounts Manager, or Warehouse User—ensuring each team member sees only what they need.\

**Customer**\
A Customer can be an individual or organization that buys your products or services; profiles store contact details, billing/shipping addresses, credit terms, and purchase history for accurate order management.\
Sales ▶️ Customer

**Supplier**\
A Supplier is any entity that provides goods or services—raw materials, packaging, or maintenance; supplier records capture contacts, payment terms, lead times, and performance metrics.\
Buying ▶️ Supplier

**Item**\
An Item is a product, sub-assembly, raw material, or service that CGIC buys, sells, or manufactures; each Item has a unique code, default unit of measure, and can be grouped for reporting and pricing.\

**Account**\
An Account is a ledger heading—such as “Cash,” “Sales,” or “Travel Expense”—under which financial transactions post; the CGIC App manages your customers’ and suppliers’ balances automatically, so you only configure truly standalone accounts.\

**Fiscal Year**\
A Fiscal Year defines your accounting period (e.g., Jan–Dec); transactions can only be recorded within open years, and closing one rolls balances into the next as opening balances.\

**Journal Entry**\
A Journal Entry records one or more General Ledger lines whose debits and credits net to zero, letting you adjust balances, record manual entries, or correct postings behind the scenes.\
Accounting ▶️ Journal Entry

**Sales Invoice**\
A Sales Invoice is the bill you send to a Customer once goods or services are delivered; it records revenue, applies taxes, and creates an Accounts Receivable balance.\
Accounting ▶️ Sales Invoice

**Purchase Invoice**\
A Purchase Invoice is the bill you receive from a Supplier for delivered items or services; it logs expenses, taxes, and creates an Accounts Payable liability.\
Accounting ▶️ Purchase Invoice

**Material Request**\
A Material Request is an internal requisition for raw materials or parts—either manually created by users or auto-generated when stock falls below reorder levels—serving as the first step in your procurement workflow.\
Procurement ▶️ Material Request

**Bill of Materials (BOM)**\
A BOM lists all components, quantities, and operations needed to build a finished or semi-finished product, driving material planning, costing, and work order generation.\
Production ▶️ Bill of Materials

**Work Order**\
A Work Order is a production instruction derived from a BOM, specifying the quantity to manufacture, the operations to perform, and the resources to consume on your shop floor.\
Production ▶️ Work Order

**Stock Entry**\
A Stock Entry records any movement of inventory—receipt, issue, or transfer—updating warehouse balances and triggering stock valuation adjustments in real time.\
Stock ▶️ Stock Entry

**Purchase Receipt & Delivery Note**\
A Purchase Receipt confirms goods received from a Supplier (against a PO), and a Delivery Note confirms goods shipped to a Customer (against a Sales Order); both adjust stock levels and link back to their originating documents.\
Stock ▶️ Purchase Receipt / Delivery Note

**Quality Inspection**\
A Quality Inspection captures test results for an Item at receipt or before delivery, allowing you to accept or reject batches based on defined quality parameters.\
Stock ▶️ Quality Inspection

**Currency**\
The CGIC App supports multi-currency transactions—converting foreign amounts to your company’s base currency at specified exchange rates—while maintaining the flexibility to report and transact in local terms.\
Setup ▶️ Currency

**Print Format & Terms**\
Print Formats and Terms & Conditions let you customize how documents (Quotations, Invoices, POs) look and the legal text they include, ensuring consistent branding and compliance.\
